# Operator model: overlays, operators, and derived sequences

Design, agreed in a review of the 2026-09-20 draft. Supersedes the
`OPERATOR_MODEL_PLAN.md` on branch `operator-model-argspec` (PR 215). Nothing
here is built. §12 lists the spikes that gate the parts that need hardware.

The previous draft's diagnosis of today's tree stands and is not repeated:
every file and line it cites was checked and lands where it says. What changed
is the design built on top of that diagnosis. §1 is the summary of what moved
and why; the rest is the design as agreed.

---

## 1. What changed from the previous draft

| previous draft | now | why |
|---|---|---|
| one `interface()` method per operator, declaring host buffers | two classes: an **Overlay** declares what configures the array, an **Operator** declares the host buffers against it | the overlay depends on data movement *into* the array (tile shapes, columns, dtypes); the sequence depends on host extents. One declaration conflated them, so nothing could be reused by construction and everything had to be checked by comparison. flm/gemm already lives this split by hand |
| shapes are arbitrary Python over compile-time fields | a shape dimension is a **bare field or an integer**; a conditional may only test a field with a default | inference becomes a lookup instead of a solver. The draft's own examples (`size // tile_size`, `if b_col_maj`) needed the resolver it claimed to have dissolved |
| declaration in a method body, names recovered by a `__setattr__` hook | declaration **at class level**, names from the descriptor protocol, fields usable by bare name | once shapes are field references there is nothing left for a method body to do; the hook and its three guard checks go |
| `tuning()` on the operator, deriving overlay tunables from the extent (`tile_size_output = M // cols`) | `tuning(dev)` on the **overlay**, from the device only; `for_extent(...)` is the explicit opt-out | tuning from `M` makes the overlay depend on the extent, which defeats reuse. The operator author chooses reuse or per-shape performance, per call site |
| the design restates the ABI (`L3_*_ty`, `Runtime(seq, fn_args=[...])`) and E7 checks identity | the **library owns `Runtime` and `Program`**; a buffer names its stream (`to=`/`from_=`) and the fill/drain sequence is **derived**; `design(rt)` is an override for irregular operators | deletes the second spelling and the checks that policed it. Most sequence designs in the tree are "tile this buffer over that stream across the columns" |
| three runtime tiers named by what rebuilds (`HostResident`, `SequenceResident`, a plain field) | two author-named markers, **`Scratchpad`** and upstream's **`DispatchTime`** | the third tier is a plain field and needs no name; reusing upstream's name avoids two vocabularies for one mechanism |
| four packaging constructors (`Overlay`, `StaticSequence`/`GeneratedSequence`, `Elf`/`Xclbin`) | **`compile(dev, boundaries=, image=)`**, everything else derived from the declaration and reported | with author-named markers the sequence kind is already declared, and the image follows from device, boundaries and markers. Only boundaries and an image override were ever the user's to choose |
| `Overlay` ABI (bindings, residents, sizes) read back from files and compared (E23) | agreement **by construction** for overlays IRON builds; read-back kept only for an external xclbin (`Overlay.from_xclbin`) | the sequence is built from the overlay's typed stream declarations, so there is nothing to compare except divisibility |
| llama four ways as the acceptance gate | **one configuration at parity**, NPU1 fallback contingent on a spike, the rest measured as experiments | the four-way matrix multiplied hardware test time for configurations two spikes may rule out |
| 31 enforcement rows | the checks that trace to an observed failure or to a mechanism this design introduces (§10) | six of the 31 guarded the hook this design removes; the coverage rows guarded hand-written sequences this design derives |
| a recorder: `g.input(shape)`, `g.param`, `g.state`, `g(Op, ...)`, outputs read by handle | a **graph function**: inputs are parameters, outputs are return values, weights are closed-over tensors, state is a closed-over `iron.state`; several graphs compile together as a **module** sharing one buffer plan | declaring inputs by shape and reading outputs by handle predates tracing; the function form is also upstream's `@iron.jit` convention, so IRON stops diverging from it |

---

## 2. Goals

Kept from the previous draft, in its numbering: 1 general purpose, 2 no string
names, 3 library quality, 4 prefill in scope, 5 per-operator tuning easy to
override, 6 tuning may fail, 7 minimal duplicated spec logic, 8 static and
build-time checking, 9 un-flatten real 2-D shapes, 11 pyright config not
per-file, 12 `Tuning` is IRON-local.

Rewritten:

- **13 (nothing works by accident)** now has a stopping rule: a check exists
  because a failure was observed in this tree, or because a mechanism this
  design introduces would otherwise fail silently. Not because a mistake is
  imaginable.
- **14 (overlay and sequence are separable)** is now the *structure* of the
  operator model (§3), not a packaging option.
- **15 (types not strings; primitives not strategies)** is narrowed back to
  priority 2. A validated enum never caused a bug here; strings for buffers did.
- **10 (coverage checks on every build)** is retired. A derived sequence covers
  its buffers by construction; an overridden one gets the checks in §10.

Added:

- **Performance is measured, and does not regress.** Parity on the llama token
  stream is the gate; per-token latency is recorded before and after.
- **Build time has a budget.** Anything that runs on every build is measured
  against it.
- **One PR demonstrates the whole thing.** Upstream changes are prototyped in
  IRON by extension where possible (§11), so the PR runs end to end before
  anything lands upstream.
- **The operator author decides reuse versus performance.** The library makes
  reuse the default and specialisation explicit, and never chooses silently.

Dropped: designing now for CNNs. No CNN operator exists; the design does not
block one and does not shape itself around one.

---

## 3. The layering

An operator's fields sort by what a change rebuilds:

| tier | lives in | examples (GEMV) | changing it rebuilds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **overlay** | the `Overlay` class | `K` (baked into the kernel), `cols`, `tile_out`, `vec`, dtypes, fifo depths, shim pins | cores, routing, PDI |
| **sequence** | the `Operator` class | `M`, `num_batches`, offsets, strides | the instruction stream only |
| **per-call** | a marker on the `Operator` | `n_rows`, `cache_offset` | nothing (`Scratchpad`) or the stream (`DispatchTime`) |

Each layer has an ABI. The overlay's is the **streams** that enter and leave
the array, in tile units, with their shim bindings. The operator's is the
**host buffers**, in extents, each naming the stream it feeds or drains. A
sequence is written against the overlay's stream declarations, so direction,
dtype, tile shape and shim binding agree by construction. The only thing left
to check is divisibility (`compatible()`, §5).

Upstream's own seam already matches this: `Program(dev, rt)` takes workers and
fifos on one side and a `Runtime` on the other. Today every IRON design builds
both in one function.

### The discipline that makes reuse real

A core program must not bake a host extent into its loop trip count, or the
overlay silently depends on `M`. **A core's trip count is either unbounded or
supplied by the sequence through a resident parameter, never a compile-time
constant derived from a host extent.** Both patterns exist in the tree: gemv
and mha loop forever; gemm, mha and flm/gemm read their counts from runtime
parameters the sequence writes before the first DMA. Every other design today
computes its count from `size` or `M` at compile time, so the migration in
§14 rewrites each of those loops. This is checkable: **build the overlay at
two extents and require the core ELFs to be byte-identical** (the trick from
the flm/gemm migration commit). It runs once per overlay class in the test
suite, not on every build.

### What it buys

flm/gemm's one-xclbin-many-shapes, for every operator. In the fused llama
graph the q, k, v and o projections are GEMVs at different `M`; today each is
a separate design, under this design they are one overlay and four sequences.
Whether the current fusion pass skips a reconfiguration when consecutive steps
share a device is **unverified** (O5) and is not counted until it is.

---

## 4. Declaring an overlay

```python
class GEMVOverlay(Overlay):
    """Array configuration for C = A @ B. Row-blocks of A per column, B broadcast."""

    K: int = param()                       # baked into the kernel: -DDIM_K
    cols: int = auto()               # None: tuning fills it from the device
    tile_out: int = auto(64)             # rows of C one core produces per acquire
    vec: int = auto()                # kernel vector width

    a = StreamIn(tile_out, K, per_column=True)
    b = StreamIn(K, broadcast=True)
    c = StreamOut(tile_out, per_column=True)

    def tuning(self, dev) -> "GEMVOverlay":
        cols = self.cols or dev.columns()
        vec = self.vec or next((w for w in (64, 32, 16) if self.K % w == 0 and self.K >= 2 * w), None)
        if vec is None:
            raise Untunable(f"K={self.K}: no vector width in (64, 32, 16) divides it")
        return replace(self, cols=cols, vec=vec)

    def design(self, dev):
        matvec = declare_kernel(
            f"matvec_{self.vec}", [np.int32, np.int32, self.a.tile, self.b.tile, self.c.tile],
            source=dev.kernels_dir / "generic" / "mv.cc",
            compile_flags=[f"-DDIM_K={self.K}", f"-DVEC_SIZE={self.vec}"],
        )
        of_b = ObjectFifo(self.b.tile, name="B")
        self.b.bind(of_b.prod())
        workers = []
        for col in range(self.cols):
            of_a = ObjectFifo(self.a.tile, name=f"A{col}")
            of_c = ObjectFifo(self.c.tile, name=f"C{col}")
            self.a[col].bind(of_a.prod())
            self.c[col].bind(of_c.cons())
            workers.append(Worker(_core, [of_a.cons(), of_b.cons(), of_c.prod(), matvec, self.K, self.tile_out]))
        return workers


def _core(of_a, of_b, of_c, matvec, K, tile_out):
    for _ in range_(sys.maxsize):            # forever: the sequence decides how much flows
        b = of_b.acquire(1)
        a = of_a.acquire(1)
        c = of_c.acquire(1)
        matvec(K, tile_out, a, b, c)
        of_c.release(1); of_a.release(1); of_b.release(1)
```

**`param()` and `auto()`** return dataclass field specifiers. Pyright sees
`K: int` as a required constructor argument and `cols: int` as optional. In the
class body the name `K` is bound to the specifier, so the stream declarations
below it use the bare name. As the class is built, its base re-attaches
each field as a class attribute, so `GEMVOverlay.K` names the dimension from
outside and `ov.K` is the integer on an instance. A `tunable` is what the
previous draft called `Tuning[T]`: a field `tuning()` may set, and pyright
checks `replace()` against the real field list.

**Streams** are declared unannotated, so the dataclass machinery ignores them
and the descriptor supplies the type. `per_column=True` makes the stream a list
indexed by column; `broadcast=True` makes it one fifo with every core as a
consumer. A stream's shim binding is the placer's unless pinned with `via=`
(§9). Direction is not spelled: `StreamIn` is a shim producer, `StreamOut` a
shim consumer.

**`tuning(dev)`** sees the device and nothing else, so a tuned overlay serves
every extent. `Untunable` is an expected outcome. An author who wants today's
one-configuration-per-shape behaviour asks for it at the call site:

```python
ov = GEMVOverlay(K=2048).tuned(dev)                        # reusable across every M
ov = GEMVOverlay(K=2048).tuned(dev).for_extent(M=1024)     # specialised, explicit
```

`for_extent` produces a distinct overlay. The graph builder warns when a
specialisation stops two operators sharing one, so per-extent overlays never
multiply silently.

**`design(dev)`** builds the array and binds each declared stream to the shim
end of a fifo. It returns the workers. It never constructs `Runtime` or
`Program`; the library does (§5). An overlay built by someone else has no
`design()` and is declared with `Overlay.from_xclbin` (§9).

**Sharing** keys off `design_key()`, which already exists, not off dataclass
hashing. Two overlays with equal keys are one build.

---

## 5. Declaring an operator

```python
class GEMV(Operator[GEMVOverlay]):
    """C = A @ B, optionally batched."""

    M: int = param()
    num_batches: int = param(default=1)

    A = In(num_batches, M, GEMVOverlay.K, to=GEMVOverlay.a)
    B = In(num_batches, GEMVOverlay.K,    to=GEMVOverlay.b)
    C = Out(num_batches, M,               from_=GEMVOverlay.c)

    def compatible(self):
        unit = self.ov.cols * self.ov.tile_out
        if self.M % unit:
            raise Incompatible(f"M={self.M} is not a multiple of the {unit} rows the overlay drains per pass")

    def reference(self, A, B):
        return A @ B
```

That is the whole operator. Each dimension is written once as a field and once
per shape it appears in; that is the floor for a pyright-checked constructor,
and it was chosen over a one-mention form (`In("num_batches", "M", "K")`)
because that form needs strings and, as the previous draft measured, makes
pyright reject valid constructor calls.

**The sequence is derived** from `to=` and `from_=`. A's `M` axis is split
across the overlay's columns and fed in `tile_out`-row tiles, B is filled once
per batch, C is drained per column. Splitting a run that exceeds the BD wrap
limit is the library's job, once, instead of GEMV's, repeat's and mha's.

The derived sequence has a fixed shape: a **preamble** that writes every
resident parameter the overlay declares (trip counts, RTPs) and sets the
worker barriers; then every fill; then every drain, each waited. Two fill
options cover what the regular operators need beyond plain tiling: a
**broadcast** fill to a per-channel fifo (weighted rms_norm's weight), and a
**repeated** re-read of a buffer through a stride-zero outer dimension
(repeat, gemv's B, flm/gemm's B).

Surveyed against every design on the PR 215 branch: **14 operators are
derivable** as they stand (relu, gelu, silu, sigmoid, tanh, layer_norm,
elementwise_add, elementwise_mul, axpy, leaky_relu, dequant, rms_norm both
designs, rope) plus softmax once the preamble exists; **eight need
`design(rt)`** (strided_copy, transpose, mem_copy, gemv, gemm, mha, flm/gemm,
mm_prebuilt); repeat is borderline and is treated as an override; the two
swiglu composites become graph functions (§8). The eight are mostly about
TaskGroup and wait structure (an outer group held across batches, one wait
per batch, queue-depth retirement, drain issued before fill) and the tiler
does not learn any of that.

**An operator overrides `design(rt)`** when the derivation cannot express its
pattern. This is what the derived one is equivalent to:

```python
    def design(self, rt):
        rows = self.M // self.ov.cols
        rt.fill(self.ov.b, self.B)
        for col in range(self.ov.cols):
            rt.fill(self.ov.a[col], self.A[:, col * rows:(col + 1) * rows, :])
            rt.drain(self.ov.c[col], self.C[:, col * rows:(col + 1) * rows], wait=True)
```

Slicing a declared buffer yields the access pattern; there is no
`TensorAccessPattern` to hand-build for the regular cases. `rt` is opened by
the library from the buffer members in declaration order, so `fn_args` and
`rt.sequence(...)` are not written, and the preamble above runs before the
override's body.

**`compatible()`** is the only cross-layer check an author writes, and it is
where the overlay's tile granularity meets the operator's extent. The library
calls it when the operator is bound to a tuned overlay.

**`reference()`** takes the `In` members in declaration order and is the only
oracle for the math.

**`InOut`** exists for in-place operators (RoPE, residual add), matching
upstream's marker.

---

## 6. Per-call values

Two markers, author-named, declared in the class body beside the buffers:

```python
class StridedCopy(Operator[CopyOverlay]):
    n: int = param()
    src = In(n, to=CopyOverlay.s)
    dst = Out(MAX, from_=CopyOverlay.d)

    dst_offset = Scratchpad(np.int32)        # patched into the BD; free per call; works under full ELF
    n_live     = DispatchTime(np.int32)      # regenerates the stream per call; xclbin only

    def design(self, rt):
        rt.fill(self.ov.s, self.src[:self.n_live])
        rt.drain(self.ov.d, self.dst[self.dst_offset:], wait=True)
```

| marker | can | cannot | cost per call | packaging |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Scratchpad(T)` | move a DMA base address; be read by a core | change a size or stride | a few words plus a sync | any |
| `DispatchTime(T)` | change sizes, strides, offsets | be read by a core on its own | stream regeneration plus a buffer allocation | xclbin only |

Misuse is a build error naming the marker. A `Scratchpad` used at a size
position, or a `DispatchTime` member in a sequence packaged as a full ELF,
each says which member, what it does, and the two ways out.

**A value belongs to the operator instance, and reuse means sharing.** A
`Scratchpad` is one device symbol per design; the strided copy llama reuses
across 32 layers has one, written once per token. Binding one handle at many
call sites is explicit sharing. Binding different handles to one instance is
an error.

**Shapes never reference a per-call value**, a `tunable`, or anything but a
`param()` or an integer. A per-dispatch extent is a `DispatchTime` member next
to a buffer declared at its maximum:

```python
    max_rows: int = param()
    x = In(max_rows, tile, to=...)
    n_rows = DispatchTime(np.int32)         # how much of x is live on this call
```

The bound `n_rows <= max_rows` is enforced on the handle at write time.
Scratchpad values are limited to 30 bits and `float32` is unsupported; the
marker says so.

### Lowering on a path without a scratchpad

On NPU1 the packaging is per-step xclbin (§8). Whether an xclbin dispatch has
a control scratchpad at all is **unverified** (spike S2). If it does not, the
library lowers as follows and reports it:

```
llama decode, npu1, per-step xclbin:
  StridedCopy.cache_offset: scratchpad unavailable on this path; lowered as DispatchTime
      (stream regenerated per call)
  Softmax.vector_size: scratchpad unavailable and the core reads it; no lowering exists.
      Make it a compile-time field or package for NPU2.
```

The first is automatic because an offset-only use is provably equivalent and
each step is one design with one sequence and no PDI load, which is the shape
the dispatch bridge accepts today. The second is an error because nothing
equivalent exists, unless the sequence can write a dispatch value into tile
memory with a register write, which is **unverified** (spike S3).

*Built (§19, "Dispatch-time values").* S2 is a no, so on an xclbin image
every per-call value is a dispatch-time scalar of its kernel: the
generator declares one keyword parameter per value, the sequence receives
its live scalar, an offset use becomes the dynamic transfer form with the
scalar added to the offset, and a core-read use is a resident the
preamble writes from the scalar (`BoundValue.bind`, as the softmax does
for its row length on that image). The last is S3's toolchain half, and
it is a yes: `aiex.npu.rtp_write` takes its value as an SSA operand and
the bridge compiles the sequence. Whether the write lands before the core
reads is the device's half. So the report above now reads "a dispatch-time
scalar; written into the array by the sequence" for the softmax, not an
error.

---

## 7. The shape rule, and inference

**A shape dimension is a `param()` field or an integer literal.** A conditional
may only test a field that has a default or is passed explicitly, never one
being inferred. GEMM's layout flags are the only conditional in the tree:

```python
    B = In.select(b_col_maj, (N, K), (K, N), to=GEMMOverlay.b)
```

An operator whose host shape is genuinely an expression of its fields
re-expresses itself with the expression's result as the field. RMSNorm's
`(size // tile_size, tile_size)` becomes `rows: int = param()` with `size`
derived. That is priority 9's un-flattening, and it is a constructor change
for every such operator, listed in §14.

**Inference is a lookup.** `GEMV(wk, x)` in a graph walks each `In`'s dimensions,
pairs position with operand dimension, binds the field or checks the literal,
and raises on conflict naming both operands. Overlay-tier fields (`K`) and
sequence-tier fields (`M`) are inferred the same way; the builder constructs
the overlay, deduplicates it by `design_key()`, tunes it once, then constructs
the operator against it. Tunable overrides in inferred form are passed through:
`GEMV(wk, x, cols=2)`.

```python
ov = GEMVOverlay(K=2048)                   # explicit
q  = GEMV(ov, M=2048)
kv = GEMV(ov, M=512)                       # same overlay, different extent

@iron.graph
def step(x):
    hq = q(wq, x)                          # explicit instance
    hk = GEMV(wk, x)                       # inferred; overlay deduplicated with ov
    return hq, hk
```

Because a bare field name in a shape is already the symbolic form, there is no probe run.
"This dimension names a tunable or a per-call value" is checked once at class
creation.

---

## 8. Graphs, modules, and packaging

### A graph is a function

Inputs are its parameters, outputs are its return values, constants are what
it closes over, and tracing supplies the shapes. This is upstream's
`@iron.jit` convention, tensors positional and per-call scalars keyword-only.

```python
kv = [iron.state((cfg.n_kv_groups, MAX, cfg.head_dim)) for _ in range(cfg.n_layers)]

@iron.graph
def decode(x, angles, *, pos: Scratchpad[np.int32]):
    for i, blk in enumerate(model.layers):
        h = RMSNorm(x, blk.norm1.weight)                  # a bare tensor is a weight
        q = RoPE(GEMV(blk.attn.q.weight, h), angles)      # RoPE is InOut: q is h's buffer
        k = RoPE(GEMV(blk.attn.k.weight, h), angles)
        StridedCopy(k, kv[i], dst_offset=pos)             # writes state; returns nothing
        scores = [Softmax(GEMV(kv[i][g], q[g])) for g in range(cfg.n_kv_groups)]
        ...
        x = ElementwiseAdd(x, o)
    return GEMV(model.out_head.weight, RMSNorm(x, model.norm.weight))

net = decode.compile(dev, x=(1, cfg.emb_dim), angles=(1, cfg.head_dim))
logits = net(x_tok, angles_tok, pos=n * cfg.head_dim)
```

| role | spelling |
|---|---|
| input | a positional parameter |
| output | a return value; a tuple for several; returned as device tensors with `.numpy()` |
| weight | any tensor the function closes over; identity is the tensor, uploaded once |
| state | an `iron.state(...)` created outside and closed over; persists on the device |
| per-call scalar | a keyword-only parameter with a marker, bound to an operator's `Scratchpad` or `DispatchTime` member; one handle at many call sites is sharing (§6) |
| intermediate | a local; pooled by live range |
| slice | indexing a handle; static slices are views, a per-call offset is the operator's marker |
| in-place | invisible; an `InOut` operator returns the handle it was given |

**Operators are called on handles.** `GEMV(w, h)` infers the overlay and the
extent from its arguments (§7); an explicit instance is `GEMV(ov, M=2048)` and
is then called the same way. The class tells the two apart by whether it
received handles. That overloading is the one wart in this form, and torch
lives with the same one between `nn.Linear` and `F.linear` (O9).

**Names come from the model if one is offered**, and only for diagnostics
and the upload log: `iron.graph(names_from=model)` maps parameter identity to
its `named_parameters()` name. A tensor that is not a registered parameter
(a RoPE table, a packed weight) is still a weight; it is named by where it
was used.

**Composites are graph functions.** swiglu_prefill and swiglu_decode are
today `OperatorSequence`s of children; they become functions that call GEMM,
SiLU and ElementwiseMul, and `CompositeOperator` goes.

**Shapes come from `compile()` or from the first call.** `compile(dev, ...)`
with shapes is the documented path. Calling an uncompiled graph with real
tensors compiles for those shapes, says so once, and dispatches. A new input
shape on a compiled graph is an error, not a recompile.

**`reference`** is the same function traced against each operator's
`reference()`; `compare` runs both with a boundary after every step.

### A module is several graphs over one buffer plan

llama has prefill and decode, and today they are unrelated: prefill runs
per-operator xclbins on its own tensors in its own weight layout, decode runs
a fused ELF with the weights uploaded into its arena. Weights are uploaded
twice, in two layouts, and the KV cache is threaded by hand. Two graph
functions that close over the same tensors and the same state objects compile
together as a **module**: one allocation for weights, state and intermediates
across both, weights uploaded once, state shared because it is the same
bytes, one image with one entry point per graph.

```python
llama = iron.compile(dev, prefill=prefill, decode=decode,
                     prefill=dict(tokens=(MAX, cfg.emb_dim), angles=(MAX, cfg.head_dim)),
                     decode=dict(x=(1, cfg.emb_dim), angles=(1, cfg.head_dim)))
llama.prefill(tok, ang, n=len(prompt))
logits = llama.decode(x, ang, pos=p)
```

Under **xclbin** a module is what `SeparateDispatch` already builds: one
chained image, one kernel per entry point, one hardware context because the
runtime keys contexts on the xclbin path. User tensors are allocated against
the device with a fixed memory group, not against a kernel, so a weight
uploaded once is a valid argument to both kernels. Nothing new is needed.

Under **full ELF** a module needs one ELF carrying two runtime sequences.
The kernel naming convention (`<device>:<sequence>`) suggests it was designed
for, but nothing in IRON or upstream's Python does it (**spike S4**). If it
cannot, the fallback is one ELF per graph with an upload per graph, which is
today's behaviour made explicit; sharing device buffers across two hardware
contexts is consistent with how IRON allocates them but is unexercised.

### The image is chosen per module

One buffer plan means one image, so the rules below apply to the whole
module, not to each graph. For llama that decides the shape of the two
targets:

- **NPU2: an ELF module.** prefill pads its length to a compile-time maximum
  and masks, as softmax already does for its vector size, so no `DispatchTime`
  member forces the module to xclbin. decode keeps `Scratchpad` on the path
  where it is known to work. One ELF with two sequences if S4 passes, two ELFs
  otherwise.
- **NPU1: an xclbin module**, built from the same source. Per-step kernels,
  `cache_offset` lowered per §6 unless S2 passes, prefill's length as a
  `DispatchTime` value if it wants one. The same build is the S1 experiment
  on NPU2, where a fused decode kernel in an xclbin has never been run.

### Boundaries and image override

Two arguments, both optional. Everything else is derived and printed under
`verbose`.

```python
net = decode.compile(dev)                                  # full ELF on NPU2, per-step xclbin on NPU1
net = decode.compile(dev, image=Xclbin)                    # one fused sequence in an xclbin (spike S1)
net = decode.compile(dev, boundaries=chunks(8))            # four dispatches of eight layers
net = decode.compile(dev, boundaries=each_step)            # today's "separate"
```

| rule | consequence |
|---|---|
| a `DispatchTime` member anywhere in the module | that graph's sequence is generated per call; the image is `Xclbin` |
| the device is NPU1 | `Xclbin`; NPU1 has no full-ELF dispatch |
| more than one boundary in any graph | `Xclbin`; one image, N kernels, one shared hardware context |
| otherwise | `Elf` |
| a sequence spans more than one device configuration | its PDI loads are expanded inline (`--expand-load-pdis`); a multi-configuration sequence cannot run otherwise |

Asking for `image=Elf` when a rule forbids it is an error that names the
member, the graph, or the device.

**Overlays are compiled once per module** and shared by every sequence that
declares against them. Today `aiecc` emits both halves from one invocation, so
sharing saves reconfigurations and hardware contexts but not compile time. An
instructions-only compile exists in `aiecc` (the instruction branch roots on
the placed-and-routed module) and is exposed to IRON as described in §11; it
does not apply to a sequence whose PDI loads are expanded inline, since that
flag forces per-core compilation back on. So compile-time reuse is real for
per-step and chunked builds and not for a single fused sequence.

**A sequence is not image-agnostic.** Full-ELF instruction streams are emitted
with DDR address folding forced off; xclbin streams fold. The library compiles
the sequence for the image it will live in, and never moves one between them.

---

## 9. The three operators that do not declare a shape function today

**flm/gemm fits.** Its dtype depends on the bfp16 packing, which is an overlay
tunable, and a buffer's dtype can reference a field the same way a dimension
does. Its config-versus-shape split is what §3 was modelled on:

```python
class FLMGEMMOverlay(Overlay):
    K: int = param()
    N: int = param()
    b_format: str = auto("bfp16ebs8")

    a = StreamIn(64, K)
    b = StreamIn(K, 64, dtype=b_format)
    c = StreamOut(64, 64)


class FLMGEMM(Operator[FLMGEMMOverlay]):
    M: int = param()
    A = In(M, FLMGEMMOverlay.K, to=FLMGEMMOverlay.a)
    B = In(FLMGEMMOverlay.K, FLMGEMMOverlay.N, dtype=FLMGEMMOverlay.b_format, to=FLMGEMMOverlay.b)
    C = Out(M, FLMGEMMOverlay.N, from_=FLMGEMMOverlay.c)
```

**mm_prebuilt fits, and is why `Overlay` has a second constructor.** Its array
is downloaded, so it has no `design()`. Its streams carry the shim pins that
today are hand-matched in comments, and its runtime parameters are resident
symbols:

```python
class MMPrebuiltOverlay(Overlay, source=Xclbin.download(URL)):
    a = StreamIn(128, 128, per_row=True,    via=[Shim(col=2 * r, channel=0) for r in range(4)])
    b = StreamIn(128, 128, per_column=True, via=[Shim(col=c, channel=1) for c in range(8)])
    c = StreamOut(128, 128, per_column=True, via=[Shim(col=c, channel=0) for c in range(8)])
    rtp = Resident(np.int32, address=4096, lock=10)
```

This is the one case that keeps the previous draft's post-compile read-back:
an overlay IRON did not build gets its declared bindings checked against
`input_with_addresses.mlir`, and a sequence declared against it that cannot
drive it gets a message naming the binding. That is the flm/gemm-against-
mm_prebuilt mismatch that is currently a comment.

`via=` pins a shim column and channel. `channel` is validated against the
two-per-direction limit from the target model at class creation; nothing
validates it today at any layer. Pinning constrains routing for everything
else, so it is a tool for external overlays and not a default.

**swiglu_prefill_stream does not fit.** Its shapes come from a graph that
stream-dse exports at build time. It gets a dynamic escape, private to the
stream package: `from_spec(...)` builds the members from the exported
description at class-creation time, and gives up pyright for that one
operator, which already skips its tests when stream-dse is absent.

---

## 10. Checks

Each row names the failure or mechanism that justifies it. **T1** pyright,
**T2** class creation, **T3** tune/bind, **T4** build, **T5** hardware.

| id | mistake | when | because |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | wrong type, missing argument, bogus kwarg at construction | T1 | real dataclass fields; the most valuable static check the previous draft measured |
| C2 | `tuning()` sets a field that is not a `tunable` | T1 | `replace()` against the real field list |
| C3 | a shape dimension is a `tunable`, a per-call value, or an expression | T2 | the shape rule (§7); the pipeline would cycle |
| C4 | a member declared with an annotation | T2 | it would become a constructor argument |
| C5 | a `Scratchpad` used at a size position; a `DispatchTime` read by a core | T4 | the hardware rule in §6 |
| C6 | a `DispatchTime` member in a full-ELF sequence | T4 | no instruction-buffer argument to swap; upstream raises the same |
| C7 | `via=Shim(channel=2)` | T2 | two per direction per shim tile; unvalidated today |
| C8 | more shim endpoints than the device has | T3 | `get_shim_dma_limit` exists; extend to the graph |
| C9 | no legal tuning for this `K` on this device | T3 | `Untunable`; the mem_copy 16-core hang compiled fine |
| C10 | extent not a multiple of the overlay's tile unit | T3 | `compatible()` |
| C11 | an overlay's core ELFs differ between two extents | test suite | the reuse discipline (§3), byte-identity; fails today for every design with a compile-time trip count |
| C12 | an external overlay's declared bindings disagree with its file | T4 | the mm_prebuilt case (§9) |
| C13 | a declared buffer never filled or drained in an overridden `design(rt)` | T4 | the derived sequence cannot make this mistake; an override can |
| C14 | DMA addresses past the end of a buffer in an overridden `design(rt)` | T4 | bounds from the slice, cheap; the coverage checks beyond this are opt-in test utilities |
| C15 | a `Scratchpad` never written before dispatch | T5 | sync-time check on the handle |
| C16 | one instance bound to two per-call handles | graph build | one symbol per design (§6) |
| C17 | `n_rows > max_rows` | write time | the bound is declared beside the buffer |
| C18 | the kernel computes the wrong thing | T5 | `reference()`; the only oracle |
| C19 | `image=Elf` requested for a module a rule forbids | compile | names the `DispatchTime` member, the graph with several boundaries, or the device |
| C20 | a compiled graph called with a new input shape | call | no silent recompile; the message names the parameter and both shapes |

Retired from the previous draft: E1, E2, E6, E14 (guarded the `__setattr__`
hook), E3, E7, E15 (guarded the design's restatement of the ABI), E16–E20 as
every-build checks (the derived sequence covers by construction; kept as test
utilities for overrides), E23 as a general check (agreement by construction;
kept for external overlays as C12), E25, E27, E28 (packaging choices the user
no longer makes).

Access *order* is still not checkable without a test: coverage can be
complete while the permutation is wrong.

---

## 11. Upstream dependencies, prototyped in IRON

Three upstream changes are needed. Each is prototyped in IRON by extension so
the PR runs end to end, and filed upstream as its own change.

| need | upstream state | IRON prototype |
|---|---|---|
| **instructions-only compile** against an already-built overlay | `aiecc --get-npu-insts [--sequence-name=]` already skips per-core compilation; `CompilableDesign.compile()` refuses an insts-only call (its xclbin and insts paths "must be set together") | **done**: `jit_compile.compile_insts(generator, insts_path)` calls `compile_mlir_module(insts_path=...)` directly, keyed on the generated text; flm/gemm's per-shape compile and mm_prebuilt's link use it, so neither builds a kernel or an image it discards |
| **dispatch bridge on a fused graph** | the single-sequence check is met by pruning the callees from the lowered module (the dispatch device is the fusion's `main`). What stops it is the second check: the bridge refuses any `aiex.npu.load_pdi`, and a multi-configuration stream always has them, because `--expand-load-pdis` preloads an empty PDI before each configuration's writes (`AIEExpandLoadPdi.cpp`); the Python dispatch runtime cannot supply PDI resources | settled and shelved: the fused sequence forwarding its steps' scalars, the pruning and the named refusal are on `claude/iron-pr215-step5-extras`. Values on a fused xclbin sequence need a native dispatch host (`aiecc --get-npu-cpp`), or the values fixed at compile time; the per-step form is built here and is what NPU1 decode uses |
| **scratchpad on the xclbin path** | `ParameterScratchpad` reads a run handle's control-scratchpad buffer, wired only to the full-ELF flow | **spike S2** first; if the buffer exists on an xclbin run, wrap it in IRON; if not, the lowering rule in §6 applies and no prototype is possible |

Also upstream: a builder for `aiex.configure`/`aiex.run` (IRON emits them by
rewriting MLIR text today). Multiple runtime sequences per device turned
out to exist already: `aiecc --sequence-name` defaults to all, a device
with two `aie.runtime_sequence` ops builds to one full ELF carrying both
(S4 below), and `SequenceFullELFCallable` already names its kernel
`device:sequence`. What remains for a module with two entry points is
IRON emitting the second sequence, by the same text rewriting the fusion
pass already does. Neither blocks the decode-only PR.

---

### 11a. The elementwise template against upstream's

`iron/common/elementwise.py` is one overlay -- `ElementwiseOverlay` -- with
two declared stream shapes over it (`ChanneledUnaryOverlay`,
`BinaryElementwiseOverlay`); its `design()` reads whatever streams it was
declared with, so a third input needs no new code. It is the same design as
`aie.iron.algorithms.transform_parallel`: one core per (column, channel),
one fifo per stream per core, the extent split evenly, and the same fifo
names (`in0_<col>`, `out_<col>`, widened to `_<chan>` when there is more
than one channel).

What keeps them two functions, rather than one call:

- **the trip count**. Upstream folds `num_elements // tile` into the core
  program, so one build serves one extent. Here it is a `Resident` the
  sequence writes (§3), so one build serves every extent -- which is what
  makes an operator reusable across a graph's steps.
- **who owns the sequence**. Upstream builds a whole `Program` and issues
  the taps itself. An overlay here returns workers and leaves the sequence
  to the library, which is what lets several operators fuse into one image.
- **the column budget**. Upstream takes every column of the device.
  `tuning()` here takes as many as the device's shim DMA budget allows for
  the streams declared (`shim_slots_per_core()`), which is what lets a
  binary kernel -- two input fifos per core -- place at all.

A useful upstream change would split `_transform_parallel_gen` in two: a
half that builds the workers and the fifo handles, and a half that wraps
them in a `Program` and a `Runtime`. IRON's `design()` would then call the
first half, and the three differences above become its arguments.

The kernels are upstream's already. `aie.iron.kernels` factories return the
`ExternalFunction` for a symbol, its source, its argument types and aie2's
LUT bundling, so an overlay's `kernel()` is one line:

| operator | factory |
|---|---|
| ReLU | `eltwise.relu_sized` |
| GELU, SiLU | `activation.gelu_sized`, `activation.silu_sized` |
| ElementwiseAdd, ElementwiseMul | `eltwise.add_sized`, `eltwise.mul_sized` |
| AXPY | `datamovement.axpy` |
| LayerNorm | `norm.layer_norm` |
| RMSNorm, WeightedRMSNorm | `norm.rms_norm_eps`, `eltwise.mul_sized` |

| Tanh, Sigmoid, LeakyReLU | `activation.tanh`, `activation.sigmoid`, `activation.leaky_relu` |

`eltwise.passthrough` (mem_copy) is the one that does not fit: it ties the
argument dtype to the bit width, and mem_copy moves bf16 lines through the
16-bit kernel, so that declaration stays local.

Anything whose compile flags carry the shape (dequant, transpose) or whose
source holds two entry points the design calls (softmax's mask) has no
factory to use and declares its own.

Tanh, Sigmoid and LeakyReLU took a hand-written declaration for a while,
because their factories pinned a 1024-element tile. That pin was wrong: all
three take the element count as a runtime argument, and what their inner
loops actually require is a whole number of vectors (32 elements, or 16 for
leaky_relu on aie2). The 1024 is the trip count they promise the pipeliner,
which Peano emits a guard for and xchesscc takes as a contract. The factories
now check exactly that -- the width always, the trip count only under
`use_chess` -- and the three overlays call them like the rest. The change is
on mlir-aie's `claude/mlir-aie-iron-upstream` branch with its tests.

IRON builds with Peano throughout. There is no xchesscc path here and no
global compiler flag: a kernel that needs one asks its factory
(`use_chess=True`), which is where the toolchain choice belongs, since it is
per kernel and upstream enforces that a design's kernels agree.

---

## 12. Spikes, before any model code

| id | question | how | if no |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** | does one fused, multi-configuration sequence dispatch correctly from an xclbin via the opcode-3 path, with PDI loads expanded inline? | two-operator fused graph, `full_elf=False`, `--expand-load-pdis --get-xclbin --get-npu-insts`; it runs or it hangs | `image=Xclbin` with one boundary has no legal construction; NPU1 is per-step only; `chunks(n)` still works (each chunk is its own kernel) |
| **S2** | does an xclbin dispatch have a control scratchpad? | XRT run handle on an xclbin kernel; try `get_ctrl_scratchpad_bo()` | §6's lowering rule; `Scratchpad` is full-ELF only; softmax's `vector_size` needs S3 or a compile-time field on NPU1 |
| **S3** | can a `DispatchTime` value be written into tile memory by the sequence? | one design with a register write whose value is a dispatch parameter; read it back from the core | core-read per-call values are `Scratchpad` only |
| **S4** | can one full ELF carry two runtime sequences, dispatched by name? | a device with two `aie.runtime_sequence` ops through `--get-full-elf`; load and run each | an ELF module is one ELF per graph with an upload per graph (§8) |

An afternoon each. S1 needs the device; S2 and S3 need a device and no design
work; S4 needs only `aiecc`. None of §4–§7 depends on any of them, and S4
matters only once prefill joins the module.

What the toolchain and the sources settled without a device (§19 has the
artifacts):

| id | settled | how |
|---|---|---|
| **S1**, build half | aiecc builds it: the fused swiglu module with `--expand-load-pdis --get-xclbin --get-npu-insts` yields `main.xclbin` (an 8-column partition, one PDI, the DPU kernel) and a 123 KB `main_sequence.bin` for the fused sequence, the four configurations' writes expanded inline, next to one xclbin and stream per configuration | the run, and whether the expanded stream configures the array the partition covers, is the device's half |
| **S2** | **no.** `xrt::run::get_ctrl_scratchpad_bo()` throws "No module associated with run object" unless the run was made from an `xrt::module`, and only `module_run_aie_gen2_plus` (the full-ELF module) implements it; the base module throws "Not supported" | read from XRT's `xrt_kernel.cpp` and `xrt_module.cpp`; so §6's rule holds: `Scratchpad` is full-ELF only, and NPU1's softmax length needs S3 or a compile-time field |
| **S4**, build half | **yes.** A device with two `aie.runtime_sequence` ops (`sequence` and `silu_only`) builds through `--get-full-elf` to one ELF whose symbol table carries both; `SequenceFullELFCallable` addresses a sequence as `main:<name>` already | loading and running each by name is the device's half |
| **S3**, toolchain half | **yes.** `aiex.npu.rtp_write` takes its value as an SSA operand ("pass a runtime sequence value to supply the RTP value at runtime"), the buffer store accepts one, and a softmax whose row length is a dispatch-time scalar written into its RTP slot builds through the dispatch bridge on both devices | that the write lands before the core's read, and the value it reads, are the device's half |

---

## 13. Acceptance

The PR is done when:

1. **Every operator is on the new declaration.** All 22, including the three
   in §9. `arg_spec`, `bind()`, the snapshot, the `*_parameter="..."` kwargs
   and the dispatch hierarchy are deleted, not left beside their replacements.
2. **llama decode is rewritten as a graph function** and runs fully fused
   on NPU2 as an ELF module of one graph, with the **same token stream** as
   the snapshot taken before the rewrite, and per-token latency within noise
   of today's, measured interleaved over at least eight rounds. Prefill stays
   as it is today and feeds the same state objects.
3. **NPU1 per-step xclbin runs llama decode**, contingent on S2 or on the §6
   lowering rule plus S3 for softmax. If neither route exists for softmax, the
   PR says so and NPU1 llama is a follow-up.
4. **`iron/tests` and `iron/operators` baselines hold** (745 / 13 skipped and
   3165 with the five known mem_copy timeouts, on the PR 215 branch).
5. **`chunks(n)` works** on the llama graph, since it costs nothing extra to
   express and is the case the packaging layer exists for.

Measured as experiments, not gates: `image=Xclbin` with one boundary (S1),
per-token latency across boundary choices, and the host-side regeneration cost
of a `DispatchTime` step against a `Scratchpad` write.

Prefill stays out. Its ~300 lines are missing operators, not authoring, and no
declaration scheme fixes that. It is the next plan, and it is where the
module (§8) and S4 become load-bearing.

---

## 14. Sequencing

| step | what | needs |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | spikes S1–S3 | device |
| 1 | `Overlay`, `Operator`, `dim`/`tunable`, streams, `In`/`Out`/`InOut`, `Scratchpad`/`DispatchTime`, the tiler, library-owned `Runtime`/`Program`; GEMV alone, byte-identical object to today's | — |
| 2 | the derivable operators: the two elementwise bases (eight operators), axpy, leaky_relu, dequant, rms_norm, rope, softmax; each finite core loop rewritten to read its count from a resident (§3) | 1 |
| 3 | the overrides: strided_copy, transpose, mem_copy, repeat, gemm, mha, flm/gemm, mm_prebuilt (`from_xclbin`), swiglu_prefill_stream (`from_spec`); the two swiglu composites as graph functions | 1, 6 |
| 4 | delete `arg_spec`, `bind()`, the snapshot test, `L3_*_ty`, `*_parameter=` | 2, 3 |
| 5 | packaging: `compile(dev, boundaries=, image=)`, the derivation rules, modules, harnesses; delete the dispatch hierarchy; the §11 prototypes | 1, S1 |
| 6 | `@iron.graph`: tracing, handles, `iron.state`, weights by identity, inference, `chunks`; replaces the recorder | 1 |
| 7 | llama decode as a graph function; parity against the snapshot; NPU1 per S2/S3 | 4, 5, 6 |

Constructor changes forced by the shape rule, to list in the PR description:
RMSNorm (`size, tile_size` → `rows, tile_size`), and any other operator whose
arg_spec today computes a dimension rather than naming one (to be enumerated
in step 2).

---

## 15. What this deletes

From today's tree: `arg_spec` (14 shape functions), `bind()` and its 15
`bind_from=` sites, `arg_spec_snapshot.json` and its three tests, the `L3_*_ty`
restatements, `output_offset_parameter`/`vector_size_parameter` and their
string spellings in llama, `SequenceDispatch` and its five subclasses,
`_DISPATCH_ALIASES`, `full_elf_path()`, one of the two `infer_buffer_offsets`
implementations, `CompositeOperator` and the two swiglu `OperatorSequence`
composites, the recorder's `g.named()`/`g.slice()` string surface, and GEMV's,
repeat's and mha's private copies of the BD wrap split.

From the previous draft: `interface()`, the `__setattr__` hook and its replay,
the symbolic probe, `specialize()` on the operator, `HostResident`/
`SequenceResident`/`OverlayResident`, `StaticSequence`/`GeneratedSequence`,
`Elf`/`Xclbin` as user constructors, `Overlay.bindings/residents/sizes` as a
general mechanism, `via=` on host buffers, `Compare`/`Reference` as classes,
and E1–E3, E6, E7, E14–E20, E23, E25, E27, E28.

Kept throughout: `Untunable` and per-device numbers from the target model,
the un-flattening, `Tuning` (as `tunable`) IRON-local, the capture surface as the
authoring layer, and the decode-drift snapshot (§18).

---

## 16. Open questions

- **O1. Resolved.** Tiler scope is sized in §5: 14 derivable plus softmax,
  eight overrides, repeat treated as an override.
- **O2. Tunable overrides in inferred form.** `GEMV(wk, x, cols=2)` reaches the
  overlay; is that the spelling, or `GEMV.with_(cols=2)(wk, x)`?
- **O3. Resolved.** Upstream's tile placer and channel allocator both use
  stable sorts keyed on constraint level and channel demand, so **op order is
  the final tiebreak for shim tile and channel**, and op order is the
  fifo-name sort. A rename can move an unpinned shim endpoint. For overlays
  IRON builds this is reproducibility only, since the sequence binds to the
  fifo it got: the library names a per-column stream's fifos from declaration
  position and column, zero-padded, never from the attribute name. For
  external overlays every stream is pinned and pinned endpoints place first.
  A `per_column` stream does not guarantee column `c`'s shim is in physical
  column `c`; the placer picks by flow centroid and load. An author who needs
  a physical column pins it.
- **O4. Resolved.** Five library sites consumed arg_spec, all wanting
  direction, shape and dtype per buffer, which the declared members carry.
  Only `share_designs` consumed arg_spec *agreement*, and under the new model
  that check inverts: two operators sharing an overlay are expected to differ
  in extent, so the check is "same overlay key, and each `compatible()`
  passes."
- **O9. The class-call overloading.** `GEMV(w, h)` records a step and
  `GEMV(ov, M=2048)` constructs. Accepted as the default; the alternative is
  a lowercase functional namespace (`iron.ops.gemv`) beside the classes.
- **O10. State semantics.** How `iron.state` is reset, read back to the host,
  and sized when the module has two graphs writing it. Decided in step 6.
- **O11. Host work between boundaries.** `chunks(n)` returns control to the
  host between dispatches; whether a graph function can express host compute
  at a boundary, or whether that is two graphs in a module, is prefill's
  problem and is deferred with it.
- **O5. Reconfiguration skipping.** Whether the fusion pass skips a PDI load
  when consecutive steps share an overlay. If not, the shared-overlay win in §3
  is hardware contexts only until it does.
- **O6. `chunks(n)` placement.** A method on the build or a free function over
  the steps.
- **O7. Verbose report format.** What `compile(dev, verbose=True)` prints: the
  image, each sequence's kind and boundaries, each per-call value's lowering.
- **O8. The `MAX_WRAP` FIXME.** `iron/common/tiling.py` already has
  `DMA_BD_MAX_WRAP` and a shared `split_run`, with a comment arguing the wrap
  is identical across every target model IRON builds for. The tiler uses the
  shared helper; the FIXME closes by deletion, not by `dev.max_wrap`.

---

## 17. Corrections to the previous draft's claims about upstream

For the record, so nobody re-derives them:

- `aie-materialize-runtime-sequences` **does not erase** inlined callee
  sequences; an upstream test asserts the callee device survives. The previous
  draft's spike 0b would fail on its first grep. This is why §11 prunes before
  the bridge's check.
- The instruction branch in `aiecc` roots on the placed-and-routed module, not
  on the module with compiled ELFs, so an instructions-only compile already
  exists in the toolchain. `--expand-load-pdis` forces it back onto compiled
  cores. The previous draft's L2 was near, and unavailable for exactly the
  mode it called load-bearing.
- `ParameterScratchpad` is wired only to the full-ELF dispatch flow. The
  previous draft's configs B, Ca and Cb could not carry `cache_offset` as
  written.
- Full-ELF instruction streams are emitted with DDR address folding forced
  off; xclbin streams fold. A sequence is not interchangeable between images.
- `requires_pdi_resources` is a local flag inside the bridge's check, not an
  attribute. `_check_runtime_sequence_abi` is a module function in
  `_dispatch_compile.py`, not a method. `split_params` and
  `_TensorPlaceholder` live in `_introspect.py` and `_serialization.py`.
- Upstream already has `specialize(**overrides)` meaning "bind a dispatch
  parameter"; the previous draft's `op.specialize(dev)` reused the name for a
  different operation.
- `InOut` exists upstream and was omitted.
- `schedule=` never existed in the tree; the previous draft was deleting it
  from its own earlier version.
- IRON never passes `dispatch_params` to anything; the previous draft's §11
  critique of `has_dispatch` describes upstream code.

---


### The operator layout and its tests

One operator is one module: `iron/operators/relu.py` for a small one, a
directory with `op.py` for one that also carries a design, a reference, a
README or a device test of its own (`gemm/`, `gemv/`, `mha/`, `rope/`,
`swiglu_*/`, `flm/gemm/`). Seventeen directories became files.

The per-operator `test.py` files are gone too, and with them the pattern
they all repeated: 18 modules whose entire content was one
`operator_test(cls, cases, ...)` call plus the case builder it needed.
An operator now declares the shapes it is checked at as
`test = Testing(cases, rel_tol=, abs_tol=, draw=)` on the class
(`iron/common/testing.py`, data only, no pytest or torch import), and one
module, `iron/operators/test.py`, runs every declaration: construct, draw
with `golden`, dispatch, compare against `reference()`. The cases are
`Case(kwargs, extensive=)` or plain dicts, or a callable returning them
when they follow the device's width, which is what most operators need.

The conversion was checked rather than argued: every declaration was
resolved against an eight-column device and diffed, case by case, against
what its deleted `test.py` generated -- same kwargs in the same order,
same `extensive` marks, same tolerances, same presence of a `draw` hook.
522 cases over 19 operator classes, all identical. What remains beside an
operator is a device test with a body of its own (the composites compared
step by step, flm's accumulator comparison), and a shape the operator must
*refuse* now lives in `iron/tests/operators/rejected_shapes.py`, which
needs no device.

`iron/tests/common/cases.py` stays as it is: one small pinned construction
case per shape decision, device-free, which the lowering gate runs. That
is a different question from "what shapes stress the hardware", and
merging the two would lose one of them.

### The compile path, after the artifact graph

IRON no longer names build outputs. `CompilableDesign` owns building and
caching: every compile lands in an entry keyed on the content it was built
from (`~/.npu/cache/<hash>/`), locked across processes and validated
against the kernels' depfiles. `iron/common/jit_compile.py` is the seam,
four functions over one idea -- how an IRON design becomes the generator
upstream runs inside `compile()`, so the kernels a design declares are
collected and built: `fused_design` (the full ELF), `xclbin_design` (one
link of a chain), `insts_design` (the runtime sequence alone, against an
image built elsewhere), `dispatch_stream` (a dispatch-time design's bridge
library). What went: the artifact graph (`compilation/base.py`,
`compilation/sequence.py`, `common/base.py`: rules, commands, artifacts,
staleness, ~920 lines) whose only remaining job was downloading the
shipped xclbin -- now `external.fetch`, one function -- and IRON's own
change detection (`_compile_if_changed` and its `.cache_hash` stamps),
which duplicated what the cache does.

What replaced it is a record rather than a build system.
`iron/common/artifacts.py` is what a compiled image *consists of*, by
identity: its designs, which operators share each, which step runs which,
where each buffer lands in the image's plan, and the entry that holds the
image and its sidecars (`params.txt`, `input_with_addresses.mlir`). One
shape for an operator compiled alone (one design, one step) and for a
graph, so the trace parser, the parameter scratchpad and the tests all
read it rather than re-deriving a directory layout. `compile(record="disk")`
also writes it beside the image; by default it is kept in memory.

There is no build context left to carry either. `AIEContext` held six
things, and only one was a choice: `kernels_dir` and `base_dir` are facts
about the install and the checkout (now `iron.operators._kernels`'
`kernels_dir()` and `iron_kernels_dir()`), `compiler` is gone with the
xchesscc path (IRON builds with Peano; a kernel that needs chess asks its
factory), `mlir_verbose` printed three lines from GEMV's design, `build_dir`
named where a downloaded image landed (now the JIT cache's own `prebuilt/`),
and `record` is a keyword on `compile()`. An operator takes the device that
is current and nothing else.

Alongside it, `iron/common` gave up what was not its own. The stream-dse
path moved under the one operator that uses it
(`iron/operators/swiglu_prefill_stream/stream/`, with `layout.py`, whose
`TiledStridedLayout` is a stream-dse notion and not an access pattern),
tracing moved to `iron/operators/_tracing.py`, and `device_utils.py` is
gone: the architecture string is upstream's `resolve_target_arch`, the
column count is `dev.cols`, and `lut_sources` belongs with the kernels it
bundles (`iron/operators/_kernels.py`). The fifo-depth rule no longer
spells 4096: `L1_BANK_BYTES` is named once, with the reason a line
spanning two banks cannot be double-buffered, and the threshold follows
from the stream's dtype. The banking is the one device fact the target
model does not expose (it gives the total only), so an accessor for it is
the next small upstream ask.

`tile_size` was already tunable on both elementwise bases; what is fixed
is the fallback (256) and each kernel's `tile_cap`. The cap is a kernel
property, not a device one, so it stays declared; raising the fallback is
a performance decision and needs hardware, so it is left alone.

Two changes upstream made that possible, on mlir-aie's
`claude/mlir-aie-iron-upstream` branch:
`CompilableDesign.get_cache_entry()`, which names everything a compile
left in its directory, and `insts_only=True`, an instructions-only mode
that used to be refused (its xclbin and instruction paths had to be set
together), which is why IRON reached past `compile()` to
`compile_mlir_module` with a cache of its own.

## 19. Status

What is on this branch, and how far each piece has been verified. Three
environments are distinguished: **sandbox**, a session with no device,
where the pure-Python layers run under pytest against a stub of the
upstream module names; **lowering**, the same session with the pinned
mlir-aie wheel, Peano and `aiebu-asm` installed but no device, where
every design generates real MLIR, `aiecc` places, routes, assigns
addresses, lowers the DMAs and emits the instruction stream, the kernels
compile, and a traced graph builds to the fused ELF `xrt::module`
loads; and **device**, a machine with hardware, where nothing here has
run. How the toolchain was obtained without a device is worth a line,
since the index pages that name the assets are what a sandbox cannot
reach: the mlir-aie wheel and the Peano wheel are release assets whose
download URLs resolve directly (Peano's name and version are spelled out
in mlir-aie's `utils/update_peano_version.py`), `aiebu-asm` builds from
`Xilinx/aiebu` with its three submodules and Boost, and `xclbinutil` is
the Boost-free one mlir-aie vendors under `tools/hrx-xclbinutil`, built
standalone with one fix (below). No XRT is installed, so nothing loads.

### The lowering gate

`iron/tests/toolchain/lowering.py` lowers every case of the construction
table on npu2 and npu1 shapes (116 runs, 12 skipped as incompatible with
the narrow device), and `lowering_graph.py` lowers what the table does
not cover: every operator the decode graph traces, with its bound
per-call values as scratchpad parameters; flm/gemm's three sequence
shapes and its configuration-only module at the reference shape; the
external mm_prebuilt sequence (raw-dialect emission, no cores); and the
swiglu graphs' operators. All lower. The fused module `swiglu_decode`
builds through `OperatorSequence` (five devices: four configurations and
the dispatch sequence with `aiex.configure`) places and routes and emits
one instruction stream per device, the main one included.

### The full ELF

`iron/tests/toolchain/full_elf.py` goes the rest of the way on two
graphs, through the same path `CompiledGraph` takes
(`TracedGraph.sequence` → `OperatorSequence` → `compile_sequence`): the
kernels compile with Peano, every core links, each design's PDI is
generated, and `aiebu-asm` assembles the streams and PDIs into one ELF.
The swiglu decode graph builds in about 17 s (four PDIs, an empty
parameter table). The llama decode graph at the scaled test config (two
blocks, 50 steps, 6 bound values) builds in about a minute to a 6.3 MB
ELF whose scratchpad parameter table, emitted only on this path, has
exactly two rows:

| parameter | kind | written where |
|---|---|---|
| `StridedCopy_..._out_offset` | `addr` | patched into the sequence's descriptors |
| `Softmax_r16_n256_c1_ch1_npu2_vector_size` | `core` | read by the core behind its barrier |

Six bindings, two rows, and that is the sharing the graph intends: the
key and value copies of every block are one design, so one
`cache_offset` write reaches them all, and likewise the softmax's
vector size. The test asserts each bound value's symbol is in the table.

The same build at Llama 3.2 1B's real configuration (16 blocks, 386
steps, 48 bindings, 19 distinct designs) takes about three minutes and
produces a 13.3 MB ELF with the same two-row table. That is the image
`npu.py` would load; only the load and the token snapshot are
left.

### The xclbin gate

`iron/tests/toolchain/xclbin.py` builds the other image, one xclbin per
design, on each path that lowers that way: a graph's separate dispatch
on npu2 and npu1 (the swiglu decode graph: five steps, four designs,
the gate and up projections sharing one kernel instance and one
instruction stream), flm/gemm's two compiles (the configuration's xclbin
at the reference shape plus this shape's instructions), mm_prebuilt's
instruction stream against its external overlay (and the download of the
image itself, which this session's network allowed), and a plain
operator's `compile()` on npu1. All pass.

`iron/tests/toolchain/full_elf.py` and `xclbin.py` then run the packaging surface end
to end: `compile(dev, boundaries=, image=)` on the swiglu decode graph
derives `elf`/fused on npu2 and `xclbin`/separate at `each_step` on
npu1, builds the sequence and links the image, and stops there.
`OperatorSequence.compile()` now links the image (`link()`, idempotent;
`get_callable()` still goes through it) and `CompiledGraph` makes the
runtime on first use, so a build host with the toolchain and no NPU
compiles ahead of time and hands `net.image` on. Before this the ELF
was only linked on the way to a callable, and `compile()` on such a
host stopped short of the one thing worth having.

Two things were wrong on the way. `SeparateDispatch.link_xclbins`
linked one xclbin per operator instance where the fused path built one
per design, so a graph with shared designs paid a chained compile per
step; it now iterates `unique_designs()` and maps every operator onto
its design's artifacts. And the vendored `xclbinutil` could not link a
chain at all: its property-tree shim split an empty path into one empty
key, so the `put("", v)` every section uses for array elements dumped
each element one level too deep (`"start_columns": [["0"]]`), and
aiecc's `--xclbin-input` step, which re-adds the dumped partition,
failed on the empty value. The fix (an empty path names the node
itself, as in boost) and a round-trip step for the tool's smoke test
are in `iron/tests/toolchain/patches/hrx-xclbinutil-empty-path.patch`,
against mlir-aie's `third_party/hrx-xclbinutil`; the smoke test fails
without it and passes with it. It belongs upstream.

The GEMV object gate is satisfied by construction: no kernel source
differs from the PR 215 tree and GEMV's MLIR is byte-identical, so the
same aiecc run produces the same object.

### Reference parity

`GraphFunction.reference` runs a graph operator by operator through each
operator's `reference()` on host tensors. It now models what the device
would: a state passed as an output is written in place (the strided copy
scatters into the cache and leaves the rest), and the per-call values a
site binds reach the reference as numbers (the cache offset moves the
copy, the vector size masks the softmax as the kernel does). With that,
`iron/tests/common/llama_reference.py` compares the graphs' references
against the model's plain forward (`Llama.forward`, a stateless causal
pass in torch; it replaced the hand-written `llama_cpu.py` and its CPU
cache once prefill was ported, since a causal pass over `t + 1` tokens
gives at position `t` what a cached decode gives at step `t`), on one
prompt at a scaled configuration: decode fed the prompt one token at a
time from an empty cache, and prefill handing decode its caches. Per
token, the largest logit difference is about 1% of the logit scale (both
sides are bf16 with different operation orders) and the argmax agrees at
every step. So the graph's wiring, the flat cache layout and its seeding, the
reshapes, the scale, the repeat, the batched transposes and products,
matches the model; what hardware adds is the kernels' arithmetic.

The same comparison with the softmax's valid length written as the old
running sum is what settled §18's first candidate (see there). Four
references were made faithful for it: StridedCopy had none; Softmax
ignored the vector size; GEMV's and Transpose's did not batch.

The device-free suites were also run against the real package instead of
the stub. `iron/tests/common` passes (the stubbed design probe it once
held is gone: the lowering gate runs the same case table for real, and
the probe only ever ran where the real package was absent). In
`iron/tests/infrastructure`, `lazy_imports.py`
needed its notion of a composite updated (a graph function's factory,
not an `OperatorSequence` subclass) and passes; what fails there fails
for want of hardware: `sequence.py` and `graph_dispatch.py` need
`pyxrt` and a bound device, and one test in `jit_compile_path.py`
asserts that binding the device inside the cache stamp reproduces the
hash a bound compile computes, which needs a device to bind (the rest
of that file, the xclbin and ELF compiles included, passes). Those are
the on-device list below.

Against the PR 215 tree, generated MLIR for the same constructions:

| operators | result |
|---|---|
| GEMV (plain and batched), GEMM (all four cases), MemCopy, StridedCopy (all three) | **byte-identical** |
| the elementwise families (ReLU, GELU, SiLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, LayerNorm, LeakyReLU, AXPY, ElementwiseAdd/Mul), Dequant, Transpose, Softmax | differ only by the resident count read behind a barrier (a buffer, a lock, `rtp_write` + `set_lock` in the sequence, `memref.load` in the core) and the SSA renumbering that follows |
| Repeat, RoPE | that, plus flat host argument types (`memref<512xbf16>` for `memref<8x64xbf16>`); descriptors identical |
| MHA | flat host argument types and linear Q/K/V/O descriptors (`[1,1,1,4096]` for `[1,1,64,64]`): same offsets, lengths and order |
| WeightedRMSNorm | no old counterpart with these keywords |

Three things were made identical along the way: residents are written
one buffer at a time in word order (the old sequences' order), GEMM's
parameter buffers keep their zero initializer, and leaky_relu's object
keeps its old name. Two case-table entries turned out to be invalid in
the old tree as well (a stride-1 transpose the hardware refuses, an f32
GEMM that overflows a core's memory) and are now valid configurations.

What the gate cannot check: the kernels (Peano), the numbers (hardware),
and the decode graph's parity against the token snapshot (§18).

Step 2 is complete. Step 3 so far: repeat, strided_copy, transpose, gemm
and mha are declared overrides (`design(rt)` over the same `Sequence`), with
their access patterns kept as explicit descriptors (mha's as buffer slices)
and their RTP values as residents; `select()` carries gemm's layout
transposes and `Overlay.device()` its NPU1 column variants. mha's four
per-worker RTP words are four residents bound at an index into the same
buffers, and its `legalize_tas` hack is `tiling.legalize` through a slice.
The snapshot test, run under the stub for the first time, caught two
losses: SiLU's fixed single channel (`auto(1, init=False)` now) and a
StridedCopy case the old design would have asserted on (now a real
gather).

flm/gemm is the model's showcase: `FLMGEMMOverlay` is exactly what the
xclbin depends on (its `config_name` is the stem), `GEMM` is the shape and
activation as residents, and `tuning(dev)` no longer looks at K; the legacy
constructor reproduces the old K-dependent `tile_n` default by passing it
explicitly. mem_copy's array was already extent-free. mm_prebuilt is the
external case: an `Xclbin` class attribute in place of `design()`, streams
pinned with `via=Shim(col, channel)`, a `Resident(address=, lock=)` block,
and `iron.common.external` emitting the raw-dialect sequence the old
`design.py` hand-wrote; task groups are no-ops there and the per-slot
queue bound comes from the stream's `depth`. The C12 read-back against
`input_with_addresses.mlir` is not done: a downloaded xclbin has no such
file, so the check is structural (every stream pinned, every resident
addressed) at class creation. swiglu_prefill_stream's group is
`from_spec`: a class built at run time from the exported shapes,
with the group digest as its sharing key and the stream-dse loader as its
artifact; the `OperatorSequence` composite around it stays until step 6.

Step 4 is done; the two legacy value spellings (strided_copy's
`*_offset_parameter` fields, softmax's `vector_size_parameter`) went once
the decode graph bound its values by handle. The recorder
(`iron.common.capture`) is gone too: `@iron.graph` is the authoring
layer, and `TracedGraph.sequence()` is the one seam onto the image
builder that both `CompiledGraph` and the infrastructure tests use. The snapshot test is gone with its
purpose; the shape regression net is now the per-operator device-free
tests in `iron/tests/common`, which pin shapes, tuning, residents and
transfers rather than a recorded table.

Step 6 is in: `@iron.graph` traces a function on handles, where a class
call on handles (`GEMV(w, h)`) infers, deduplicates the overlay by
`design_key()` and records, an instance call records against that
instance, a bare tensor is a weight, `iron.state(...)` is a pinned buffer
the graph writes into by passing it as an output, keyword-only parameters
annotated `Scratchpad[T]`/`DispatchTime[T]` are per-call values bound to
an operator's members (`use_value` enables them; two handles on one
instance is an error), and `h[a:b]` is a byte-range view. Three rules the
tracing forced: a flat declared buffer (`In(size)`) takes an operand of any
rank; every overlay tunable has a device default (elementwise tiles of
256, every column the shim budget allows, RMSNorm one core, transpose 64 x
64 x 8) so inferred construction needs no tuning arguments, and a call site
that knows its extent passes better ones; both construction paths go
through `_split_kwargs`, and `overlay_defaults` fills the one kind of
overlay field the operator's own extent decides (a copy's transfer size). Lowering targets `OperatorSequence`
as it stands (a fused ELF on NPU2, per-step xclbins on NPU1); `compile(dev,
boundaries=, image=)` and the image rules are step 5. O2 is settled as the
kwargs spelling (`GEMV(wk, x, num_aie_columns=8)`). O9 stands: the class
tells the two calls apart by receiving handles. O10: state is zero at
upload, read and written through `CompiledGraph.buffer(state)`, and sized
by its declaration; a module with two graphs over one state is step 5.

Step 3 is complete: `swiglu_decode(w_gate, w_up, w_down)` and
`swiglu_prefill(...)` return graph functions closing over the weights;
`CompositeOperator` and the two `OperatorSequence` composites are gone.
Two more graph rules came with them: a flat-declared output (an
elementwise operator) keeps the shape of the operand it is the size of,
and `h.reshape(...)` is a free view. `Operator.design_key()` is now the
class, the overlay's key and every compared field, so a sequence builds
two identical projections once (`share_designs`).

Step 7 is written: `DecodeGraph` (in the application, importable without
a device) closes over the module tree, keeps the per-layer caches as
`iron.state((n_kv_groups, max_seq_len * head_dim))`, and takes
`cache_offset` and `vector_size` as `Scratchpad[np.int32]` parameters; the
per-head transposes are one batched `Transpose`, and each value binds to
the operator's own member or, for the softmax, to the dynamic overlay's
core-read member (the tracer looks on both). `npu.py` compiles it
against `build_elf`, calls it per token, and seeds the caches after
prefill through `CompiledGraph.write(state, tensor)`, which also pushes
the bytes to the device. Prefill is unchanged (per-operator xclbins,
O11).

Step 5 is started at the surface: `compile(dev, boundaries=, image=,
verbose=)` derives the image by the §8 rules, refuses `image=elf` where a
rule forbids it (naming the value, the boundaries or the device), reports
each value's lowering, and lowers `elf` to the fused ELF and `xclbin` +
`each_step` to the chained per-operator xclbin that exist today. Of the
rest, the toolchain halves are done (§12's second table): the fused
sequence builds as an xclbin with its stream expanded (S1's build), two
sequences build into one ELF (S4's build), the control scratchpad is
settled from XRT's source as ELF-only (S2), and the instructions-only
compile is in use (§11). S2 being a no, per-call values on the xclbin
image are lowered as §6 says: dispatch-time scalars of each kernel, an
offset use in the dynamic transfer form and a core-read use written into
the array by the sequence (S3's toolchain half, a yes). The decode graph
builds for NPU1 at `each_step` that way, at the scaled and the real
size, which is acceptance item 3's build.

What was built past that on the assumption S1 and S4 run is **shelved on
the branch `claude/iron-pr215-step5-extras`**, with its tests and its
plan text: `chunks(n)` and the one-chunk xclbin (a fused sub-sequence
per kernel, switches expanded, chained into one image), modules over
several graphs (one buffer plan, one ELF with a named sequence per
graph, `iron.compile(dev, name=(graph, shapes), ...)`), and per-call
values on a chunked image, which upstream's Python dispatch bridge
cannot run anyway (§11). None is needed for decode, and chunks rests on
an unrun spike; this branch carries the two images decode uses, the
full ELF on NPU2 and the per-step chain on NPU1. Acceptance item 5
(`chunks(n)` on the llama graph) goes with them. What still needs a
device: S3's read and the regenerated streams, running S1's and S4's
images if the shelved work returns, and the infrastructure tests that
drive the dispatch builders by name. O6 is settled as free functions
(`iron.chunks`, `iron.each_step`, the former refused by name here); O7
by `Plan.report`.

**One spelling per operator.** The keyword constructor takes exactly the
declared fields: `RMSNorm(rows=)` and `WeightedRMSNorm(rows=)` rather than
`RMSNorm(size=, weighted=)`, `GEMM(dtype_in=bfloat16)` rather than
`"bf16"`, and `Softmax(x, vector_size=n)` with a per-call `n` resolves to
`DynamicSoftmax` (a class of its own, exported by name like
`WeightedRMSNorm`). The per-class `_classic` translators, the `__new__`
that swapped RMSNorm's class, and the eighteen `_name_aliases` tables that
kept old artifact stems are gone; artifact names are the declared field
names, so a build cache filled before this point is rebuilt once. Two
hooks replace them: `resolve_class(n_operands, kwargs)` picks the class
from the operands and the per-call values, and `overlay_defaults(kwargs)`
fills an overlay tunable the operator's extent decides (strided copy's
transfer size). What was a shape-dependent default is now tuning: flm
GEMM's `tile_n` is the table's 64 on every K (the old constructor chose
128 at K = 512 on NPU2, a measured 9% there; pass `tile_n=128` at a call
site that wants it), and `m_chunk` is the table's value, checked against
the extent by `compatible()` rather than silently reduced to 1. The
llama prefill and the rms_norm operator test construct in the new
spelling.

**The tests were cut to what is checked.** The stubbed design probe
(`designs_run.py`) never ran where the real package is installed, so it
is gone; the two arg-spec modules are one test in `declare.py`; a file
named on the command line collected twice (pytest collects an initial
path itself, whatever its name) and now collects once. The 24
`generate_golden_reference` functions are one `vectors(op)` in
`iron/common/harness.py`, drawing every declared input in declaration
order and taking the outputs from `op.reference()`, which every operator
now has (gelu and layer_norm had none beyond their generator; dequant's
unpacks what the kernel unpacks; MHA's is causal attention with the
padding rows zeroed; RoPE's reads the bf16 angle table for both methods).
The host proof against a worktree of the previous commit: identical
vectors for every operator at the tests' regular shapes, except that a
column-major GEMM B is now drawn in its stored layout (the reference on
the old matrix reproduces the old C exactly), RoPE's output differs from
the f32 cos/sin one by at most 0.031 (the table the device reads), and
MHA at a padded length differs in one element by one bf16 ulp. The
toolchain gate builds the swiglu graph twice fewer: the ELF and the
xclbin-chain tests go through `compile()` and carry the ahead-of-time
assertions the separate `compile.py` made on their own builds.

**Four more cuts, host-verified.** (1) `sequence.py` (1,090 → 914 lines)
has no dispatch hierarchy: a sequence carries a `mode` name, `_MODES`
maps it to an image builder (`FusedImage` for the ELF, `XclbinChain` for
the chain, none for `reference`) and a callable, and the two builders
have one method, `link`. Reference and compare are callables only; the
compare tolerances are `SequenceCompareCallable`'s. The callables lost
their extra base (`_PerBufferCallable` is the base's own buffer model;
the full-ELF callable overrides it). (2) `MLIROperator` is gone:
`Operator` inherits `AIEOperatorBase` (context, artifacts, the compile of
what is not generated) and carries `name`, `compile`, `link_xclbin` and
`get_callable` itself; the artifact-stem aliases are one table in
`declare.py`. (3) The four "legacy accessors" sections (25 properties
forwarding to the overlay) are gone; readers use `op.ov`. (4)
`members_of`, `nearly_equal`, `chunks()` (refused by name until the
shelved branch returns) and MHA's padding helpers are gone. The tests
shed their duplicates too: the toolchain gates share `tools.py` (which
tools are installed, the devices, the swiglu graph) and the `device` and
`npu2` fixtures in their conftest, and the scaled-down Llama model the
graph tests, the reference parity test and the toolchain gates trace is
one `iron/tests/common/llama_model.py`.

**The operator tests are one function each.** `operator_test(cls, cases,
rel_tol=, abs_tol=, draw=)` in `iron/common/harness.py` is the
parametrized test: construct, `vectors()`, `run_test()`, assert; the 18
operators whose test was the same thirty lines around a parameter sweep
are now a case list and that one call (`channeled_unary_cases` and
`binary_elementwise_cases` build the elementwise families' sweeps). The
tests with real bodies (gemm's partitions, flm GEMM's epilogues, gemv's
epilogue, mha's error rate) keep them. Metrics are no longer scraped out
of stdout by regex: `run_test` records latency and bandwidth through
`record_metric`, a test records anything more (throughput), and the root
conftest writes what was recorded. `verify_buffer` compares with
mlir-aie's `aie.utils.verify.nearly_equal` (same rule; a NaN now fails
rather than passing). `AIERuntimeArgSpec` and `get_arg_spec()` are gone:
the sequence layout, the callables and the harness read the declared
buffers (`op.buffers`: direction, shape, dtype, nbytes) directly. Same
cases on both devices before and after (608 on NPU2, 464 on NPU1; rms
norm's sweep is two tests, one per class); the ids are the operators'
own field names now.

What to run first on a device, in order: `pytest iron/tests/toolchain`
(it is what the lowering environment already passes; a device changes
nothing there), `pytest iron/tests/infrastructure` (the three ported
recorder tests that need a run), the GEMV and ReLU operator tests, then
the llama application against the token snapshot, with §18's two
candidates the first things to try if it drifts. The snapshot
entries for Softmax and Transpose were re-pinned to their 2-D shapes and
WeightedRMSNorm added to the case matrix. Every operator now serves
`get_arg_spec()` from its declared buffers.

Two findings while building, both now stated in the code:

- **The descriptor slot rules are not one wrap limit.** Read from
  `AIEX::verifyStridesWraps`: the innermost size is 1023 *granules*
  unless the transfer is linear or contiguous, the next is 1023 elements,
  the third has no wrap field, and the outermost is the iteration count,
  at most 64 and the only slot whose stride may be zero. GEMV's coalesced
  descriptor and repeat's re-read follow from this; `tiling.py` encodes by
  the rules rather than by example. Upstream also has an
  `aie-decompose-large-dma-bd` pass now, so an oversize pattern may lower
  without IRON splitting it; the encoder still emits legal descriptors so
  the instruction stream does not depend on that.
- **taplib is used for what it has.** `TensorAccessPattern` is the output,
  `TensorTiler2D` describes 2-D tilings for overrides, and
  `TensorAccessSequence` is the coverage check. It has no notion of
  descriptor legality, so `tiling.legalize()` takes any tap and returns
  legal ones; it is the general form of mha's `legalize_tap` and a natural
  upstream contribution.

`pytest iron/tests/common` passes without the stub, against the real
bindings, and the GEMV object gate is settled above; what remains of the
original toolchain list is the on-device half: `pytest
iron/operators/gemv iron/operators/relu`, then the rest of the ten.

---

## 18. Carried risk, unrelated to this work

**NPU decode output degrades after a few tokens** versus `llama_cpu.py` on the
same prompt and seed. Prefill reproduces exactly and the first tokens agree,
then the NPU drifts. Not the weight-naming refactor; uploaded bytes are
`torch.equal` for all 146 parameters. `iron/applications/llama_3_2_1b/test.py`
asserts only `returncode == 0`, so it does not catch this, and **a rewritten
llama will inherit it and look guilty.**

Decision: snapshot the current token stream before step 7 and make parity
against that snapshot the gate, not parity against the CPU. Cheapest real
probe if revisited: compare NPU versus CPU *logits* for one decode step rather
than sampled tokens.

Two things the rewrite kept as they were, because they may be the drift
and a rewrite is not the place to find out. The first has since been
settled without a device, by the graph's own reference (§19, "Reference
parity"), and the application now writes the context length:

- **The softmax's valid length was written cumulatively.** The old decode
  wrote `softmax_vector_size_cum += context_len` into the parameter each
  token, so after k tokens the mask length was the sum of the context
  lengths so far, not the context length; it passed `max_seq_len` within
  a few tokens. The scratchpad write is a plain store (`ParameterScratchpad.write`
  copies the value's bytes into the slot) and the softmax kernel masks
  `[vector_size, cols)` to the lowest bf16 before the exponentials, so the
  core reads the sum as a length. Modelled on the CPU with the same
  semantics, against `llama_cpu.py` on one prompt: the context length
  agrees at every token (largest logit difference about 1% of the logit
  scale, the argmax equal), the running sum agrees at the first token only
  and is off by 35% of the scale at the second and by more than the
  scale from the third, with a different argmax each time. That is the
  drift's signature. `llama_forward_pass_decode` now passes
  `vector_size=context_len`; hardware confirms.
- **The caches copied after prefill were never pushed.** The old handoff
  wrote the prompt's keys and values into the fused arena's host view and
  then called `scratch_buffer.to("cpu")`; nothing synced that arena to the
  device afterwards, so whether the first decode token saw the prompt
  depended on the coherence semantics of that call. The rewrite seeds the
  state through `CompiledGraph.write`, which pushes the buffer.

---

## 20. Prefill

Prefill is the last hand-written phase: `npu.py` builds fourteen
operators by hand, keeps two weight layouts on the device, and runs the
attention itself on the CPU (the causal mask, the softmax and the
`P @ V` product) between per-operator dispatches, reading every
intermediate back to the host. It is about 380 lines of the application
(`AIEPrefillOperations`, `AIEPrefillBuffers`, three forward functions)
against decode's 66 plus the 162-line graph. The plan is to make prefill
a second graph function over the same weights and the same cache state,
built by the same packaging, with the attention on the device.

### What was measured first (host, this session)

Each candidate step was constructed at Llama 3.2 1B's prefill size
(sequence 2048, embedding 2048, hidden 8192, 32 heads over 8 groups of
64) and lowered to an instruction stream through the toolchain gate:

| step | result |
|---|---|
| GEMM, checkpoint layout (`b_col_maj=True`), K = 2048 (the q/k/v/gate/up projections) | lowers |
| GEMM, checkpoint layout, K = 8192 (the down projection) | fails: B's outer stride (4,194,304) is past the descriptor's 2^20 |
| GEMM, K-major weight, K = 2048 | lowers (today's path) |
| MHA, 2048 tokens, 8 pipelines, 32 heads over 8 | lowers |
| RoPE over 2048 x 32 rows with 2048 angle rows | lowers |
| WeightedRMSNorm over 2048 rows | lowers |
| StridedCopy reordering (S, H, D) to (H, S, D), and (S, G, D) into the cache's (G, S, D) | fails: the copy issues its taps as given, so a 2048-wide dimension lands in a slot that holds 1023, and the descriptor length no longer matches |

So three operators need work before the graph does, and every one of
them is host-verifiable by the probe that found it. Nothing needs a new
kernel.

### The graph

```python
@iron.graph(names_from=model)
def prefill(x, angles, *, last: Scratchpad[np.int32]):
    for i, blk in enumerate(model.layers):
        h = RMSNorm(x, blk.norm1.weight)
        q = GEMM(h, blk.attn.q.weight, b_col_maj=True)        # (S, H*D)
        k = GEMM(h, blk.attn.k.weight, b_col_maj=True)        # (S, G*D)
        v = GEMM(h, blk.attn.v.weight, b_col_maj=True)
        q = RoPE(q.reshape(S * H, D), angles)                 # angle row per position, H rows each
        k = RoPE(k.reshape(S * G, D), angles)
        StridedCopy(k, keys[i], ...)                          # (S, G, D) -> the cache's (G, S, D)
        StridedCopy(v, values[i], ...)
        o = MHA(q, k, v, heads_interleaved=True)              # causal, scaled, on the device; O as (S, H*D)
        x = ElementwiseAdd(x, GEMM(o, blk.attn.o.weight, b_col_maj=True))
        h = RMSNorm(x, blk.norm2.weight)
        act = ElementwiseMul(SiLU(GEMM(h, blk.ffn.gate.weight, ...)), GEMM(h, blk.ffn.up.weight, ...))
        x = ElementwiseAdd(x, GEMM(act, blk.ffn.down.weight, ...))
    x = RMSNorm(x, model.norm.weight)
    x_last = StridedCopy(x, in_offset=last, ...)              # the last prompt row, (1, E)
    return GEMV(model.out_head.weight, x_last, ...)           # decode's projection, same array
```

Four choices are built into that sketch, each with the alternative it
was preferred to:

1. **The length is the compile-time maximum; the prompt occupies a
   prefix.** Exactly today's behaviour (every prefill operator is built
   at `max_seq_len`, the prompt sits in the first rows). Rows past the
   prompt compute on stale data and are never read: MHA is causal, so
   real rows never attend past themselves, and decode's softmax masks
   the cache tail by `vector_size`. No per-call value is needed for the
   length. The alternative, a `Scratchpad` length feeding MHA's `s_q`/
   `s_kv` residents (the softmax `vector_size` pattern), makes prefill
   cost proportional to the prompt; it is a follow-up once the fixed
   form runs, not a precondition.
2. **The output head runs for the last token only.** The harness reads
   `logits[:, -1]` and nothing else; today prefill computes the full
   (2048 x 128512) product in four partitioned GEMMs into a 526 MB
   buffer. A strided copy of the last row at a per-call offset (`last`,
   the one per-call value) and decode's out-head GEMV, which is the same
   array and the same weight, replace that. This drops the padded,
   partitioned vocabulary from the application entirely.
3. **One weight layout.** Every projection is read as the checkpoint
   ships it, (out, in), by GEMM with `b_col_maj=True`, the way decode's
   GEMV already reads it. Prefill and decode then close over the same
   tensors, which is what a module needs later. The one obstacle is the
   down projection (K = 8192), where GEMM's column-major B tap exceeds
   the descriptor's stride range; that is a legalization of GEMM's B
   fill (split the outer dimension), the same kind the tiler already
   does for derived sequences.
4. **Two images, caches handed over by copy.** Prefill and decode close
   over the same `iron.state` objects but compile to two images, so each
   holds its own allocation; after prefill the application reads the
   caches out of one and writes them into the other (16 layers x 2 x
   2 MB = 64 MB per prefill, once per prompt). Today's code does the
   same copy through host tensors. The module (one image, two entry
   points, state shared as the same bytes) is on the shelved branch and
   waits on spike S4 running; it replaces the copy without changing the
   graphs.

The MHA layout flag is the one design change: MHA reads Q, K, V and
writes O as the projections lay them out, (S, heads x D) with the heads
interleaved per token, instead of (heads, S, D). Its override sequence
already fills one head's rows per block from a slice; the interleaved
form is the same slice with the row stride heads x D, two descriptor
dimensions, no reordering copies (the probe shows those copies are the
hard part anyway). `reference()` reshapes accordingly. The cache write
stays a strided copy, because decode reads the cache as (G, L, D).

### Steps

| step | what | verified by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | StridedCopy issues its taps through `tiling.legalize` | the (S, G, D) to (G, S, D) probe lowers; the existing strided_copy cases unchanged |
| 2 | GEMM's column-major B fill legalized past the stride range | the K = 8192 probe lowers; gemm's lowering cases unchanged |
| 3 | MHA `heads_interleaved` layout, with its reference | lowering at 2048 x 8 pipelines; reference against the (H, S, D) form on the same data |
| 4 | `PrefillGraph` beside `DecodeGraph` (one module, `graphs.py`), sharing weights and states | traces; the runlist and bindings pinned like decode's |
| 5 | reference parity: prefill graph reference vs `llama_cpu.py` prefill (last-token logits, and the caches), then decode from the graph-seeded caches | `iron/tests/common/llama_reference.py`, host |
| 6 | toolchain gates: prefill's operators lower with their values; the full ELF builds at the scaled and the real size | `iron/tests/toolchain` |
| 7 | the application: the prefill section replaced by the graph, the cache handoff by `read`/`write`, `AIEPrefillOperations`/`AIEPrefillBuffers` and the CPU attention deleted | the application test; a token snapshot before and after |
| 8 | device: run, compare the token stream, measure time to first token | hardware |

Steps 1 to 3 are independent of each other; 4 needs 3; 5 needs 4; 6 and
7 need 5. Everything through 6 runs on this host.

### Status

Steps 1 to 7 are done on the host. Step 4 needed one fix in the tracer:
shape inference only received the dimension fields, so a `select()` flag
passed at the call site (`b_col_maj`, `heads_interleaved`) fell back to
its default and inference read the weight in the wrong orientation;
`Operator.infer_kwargs` now names what `infer` takes, for the tracer and
`from_operands` alike. Step 5 holds at the scaled configuration with the
decode graph four columns wide, one MHA pipeline and a 16-row GEMM tile
(the tile constraints: the length a multiple of four row tiles and of 64
per pipeline, every width a multiple of 64 columns). Step 6: the scaled
prefill ELF builds in about two minutes with `last` as the one row of
the parameter table. Step 7: `npu.py` went from 847 lines to 161;
the prefill section is one call with the prompt padded to the maximum
length, the angles table and `last = (n - 1) * emb_dim`, then the cache
handoff by `read`/`write` on the shared states. The application's
forward pass is tested on the host with both images stood in by the
graphs' references. Step 8 waits for hardware.

With prefill ported, the model's layout was cleaned up: the graphs moved
next to the parameter tree, and both then moved into the application, which
is now a package. `iron/applications/llama_3_2_1b/` holds `model.py` (the
tree and the plain forward), `graphs.py` (prefill and decode), `npu.py`
(both graphs as one image) and `harness.py` (the checkpoint, the tokenizer
and the generation loop). There is one model, so a level above it would
have nothing in it; a second Llama size would earn one. The directory is
spelled with underscores because `llama_3.2_1b` cannot be an import path,
and the application runs as `python -m iron.applications.llama_3_2_1b.npu`,
so neither it nor the tests that import it need the repository on
`sys.path`. The tests import the model through the package; the
scaled test model is the real tree at small dimensions (`Llama1B` is the
tree at the real shape with unset storage); `llama_cpu.py` and the
harness's CPU cache state are gone, the forward being the oracle; the
decode graph's `tensor=` hook and GEMM's `partition_B`/`pad_B`/
`separate_c_tiles` (the old prefill's vocabulary partitions) are gone.

Each image uploads its own copy of the weights it reads (the prefill
image the whole model, the decode image the same), as the hand-written
prefill did with its K-major copies; sharing weight buffers across images
is the module's job (§20's "what stays for later").

At Llama size the prefill graph traces (291 steps over 11 overlays) and
one layer of it builds to a full ELF (13.8 MB, about 140 s; the
`extensive` full-ELF test), so every prefill design compiles and links at
the real shape. The sixteen-layer image does not build on this host:
aiecc's lowering of the fused runtime sequence grows with its DMA tasks,
and prefill expands to 28,381 (MHA 768 per call, the down projection 320,
the other projections 128) against decode's 6,843; four layers peaked at
5.6 GB, sixteen were killed past 11 GB of the container's 16. That is an
aiecc scaling question, not a graph one. Profiled on the one-layer module
(aiecc's own process, sampled per stage): 0.1 GB until the per-core split,
2.0 GB after it, 5.2 GB at the peak of the per-core compile stages, 3.3 GB
at the per-sequence split and 3.6 GB at the end. The cause is structural:
aiecc's artifact graph (`tools/aiecc/Actions.h`, `SplitIRAction`) clones
the *whole module* once per split item and keeps the items, so the fused
module is cloned 218 times per core before lowering and, once lowered
with the main sequence materialized (28,381 tasks at sixteen layers), 17
times per device and 17 times per sequence. Memory is clones times module
size, and the module size is the expanded sequence. Two ways down: aiecc
prunes each clone to what its consumer reads (the one sequence, the one
device), which is a C++ change needing an mlir-aie build; or the
operators issue fewer descriptors, MHA first (768 per call: it refills all
of K and V for every head and every Q block, so each KV group's K and V
cross the shim 16 times per layer), which also cuts device traffic.

Done since: MHA issues one descriptor set per KV group (48 a call), and
the sixteen-layer prefill sequence is 16,861 tasks, 13,312 of them the
GEMMs' (128 a call, 320 for the unrolled down projection). That is not
enough here: the sixteen-layer build still dies at the per-sequence
split, at 11.2 GB of aiecc's own memory against the container's 16 GB
shared with the 3 GB Python parent. The remaining levers are aiecc's
clones (`AIECC_MODULE_CLONES.md`), a host with more memory (about 12 GB
for aiecc alone, as measured), or reworking the GEMM runtime sequence's
transfer blocks, which is upstream's proven whole-array design and not
worth changing without a device to check it on. Along the way the real-size build
exposed a race in mlir-aie's kernel compiler: entry points of one source
that share an object file (a GEMM's matmul and zero) compiled on
different threads, and with a symbol prefix one visit's compile could
overwrite the other's renamed object under a valid stamp, so the core
failed to link with the prefixed symbols undefined. Fixed on the mlir-aie
branch (`compile_external_kernels` groups by shared object file as well as
by name) with a unit test; the sandbox's wheel carries the same change.

### Expected results

- `npu.py` loses about 380 lines (the prefill operators, buffers
  and forward functions, the padded vocabulary and its partitions) and
  gains a graph of about 90; the application keeps embedding, the
  angles and the harness glue. (Measured: the application lost 686
  lines, the graph is 125.)
- The attention runs on the device end to end; no intermediate crosses
  to the host during prefill. Time to first token should fall, since
  today's prefill reads back q, k, v, the scores and the norms and
  softmaxes on the CPU per layer; no figure is promised before step 8.
- One weight upload, in the checkpoint's layout, for both phases.
- Parity is established on the host before hardware: the graph's
  reference against `llama_cpu.py`, the way decode's was (§19).
- Three operator improvements that stand on their own: strided copies
  legalize, column-major GEMM weights at any K, MHA in the projections'
  layout.

What stays for later, in order: the per-call prompt length (item 1), the
module (item 4), and NPU1, where MHA is not available (its array is
pinned to NPU2's memtile columns); prefill on NPU1 would need the
attention written from GEMM, softmax and transpose as decode does it,
and is not in this plan.
