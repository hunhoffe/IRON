"""Tiled-strided memory layouts for IRON operators.

A tiled-strided layout describes how a logical multi-dimensional tensor is laid
out in memory as a hierarchy of tiles, each level carrying its own ``(step,
bound)`` stride. It is the layout model AIE kernels are written against: a GEMM
microkernel, for example, reads its ``MxK`` operand as ``mt x kt`` tiles of
``r x s`` elements, which is exactly a two-level tiled-strided layout.

The types here mirror ``snaxc.ir.tsl`` (``Stride`` -> ``TiledStride`` ->
``TiledStridedLayout``) so an IRON-authored layout can be handed to stream-dse's
code generation verbatim via :meth:`TiledStridedLayout.to_snaxc`. They carry no
stream-dse / snaxc / xdsl dependency themselves -- the snaxc import is lazy and
confined to ``to_snaxc`` -- so they are usable (and testable) in a plain IRON
install with no AIE codegen toolchain present.

This is a common primitive: it is meant to be shared across operators as the one
place a kernel's operand layouts are defined, rather than re-derived per operator
or hand-copied into stream-dse.
