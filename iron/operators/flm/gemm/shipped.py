"""FastFlowLM's shipped ``mm`` overlay, as a second overlay for :class:`flm.GEMM`.

The port (:class:`iron.operators.flm.gemm.op.FLMGEMMOverlay`) is built from
source; this is the binary it was ported from, downloaded and pinned by
digest, and driven by the same operator::

    GEMM(Shipped(), M=1024, K=1536, N=6144, epilogue="silu")

It exists so the port can be measured against what it was ported from, on
identical inputs and through the same host path. NPU2 only: the image is
an 8-column binary.

Nothing here is built. The overlay names what is baked into the xclbin and
visible nowhere in it: the shim channel map (A on MM2S channel 0 of columns
0, 2, 4 and 6; B on MM2S channel 1 of every column; C out of S2MM channel
0 of every column), the address and lock of the eight parameter words every
core reads, and the order the memtiles consume transfers in. The library
emits the sequence against those pins (:mod:`iron.common.external`).

What differs from the port, and why the port is the default: the port
selects its epilogue at build time (a branch-free inner loop, one build per
activation), this binary at run time; the port rounds ``conv_even``, this
binary runs in the core's power-up floor mode and carries a ~1% truncation
bias; the port packs B in ``mm_fused_mmul_2x2``'s k order, this binary in
its own (``overlay_order``). ``GEMM(rounding=Rounding.FLOOR)`` on the port
reproduces this overlay bit for bit without an activation.
