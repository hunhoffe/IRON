    Checking a bounded epilogue against the idealized CPU reference cannot work.
    The overlay accumulates in the core's power-up floor rounding, worth ~2% of
    the accumulated mass, which here is ~65 -- larger than sigmoid's entire (0,1)
    range and than this clamp's (-2, 2). Any bound wide enough to admit that
    accumulator error also admits an all-zero result, and any bound tight enough
    to reject all-zeros also rejects correct hardware. That is why the earlier
    flat tolerance failed on working arithmetic.

    So compare the epilogue against the device's OWN accumulator instead: run
    the same inputs with no epilogue, apply the activation and clamp to that on
    the host, and require the epilogue build to agree. The accumulator error is
    then common to both sides and cancels, leaving only the epilogue under test.
    An all-zero result still fails, because the reference side is not zero.
