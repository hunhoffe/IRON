"""Every operator that declares its cases, against its reference, on a device.

One module for the whole catalog. An operator declares the shapes it is
tested at as :class:`~iron.common.testing.Testing` beside itself, and this
runs each: construct, draw inputs with :func:`vectors`, dispatch, and
judge every output element against ``reference()`` by the declared
tolerance, or else by the contract of the kernel the operator runs.

An operator whose device test is more than that -- a composite compared
step by step, a shipped binary checked against its own accumulator --
keeps its own ``test.py`` beside it.
