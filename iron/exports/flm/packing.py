"""Weight packing shared by the FastFlowLM-derived operators.

Both flm.GEMM overlays, the port and the shipped image, consume B pre-packed into the order
the compute tiles read it, so their B transfers are plain linear descriptors.
The reorder is deliberately the caller's job: expressing it as a strided
descriptor over an unpacked B leaves an innermost run of ``t`` bf16 values, so
each transfer becomes thousands of scattered bursts -- measured 5.4x slower end
to end. Weights are packed once and reused across dispatches, so the cost
belongs here.

    Blocks of 8 share the max f32 exponent in the block; each mantissa is the
    24-bit magnitude with the implicit bit made explicit, shifted right by
    17 + (maxExp - exp) to land on the shared exponent.

    That shift OBEYS THE CORE'S ROUNDING MODE. mlir-aie's reference
    ``floatToBfp16`` (``programming_examples/ml/block_datatypes/helper.h``)
    hardcodes truncation and says AIE2P always truncates -- true only of the
    power-up ``floor`` mode. The operators here call ``set_rounding(conv_even)``,
    so the kernel's own conversion rounds to nearest with ties to even, and
    matching it here is what makes packing B on the host numerically free.
    Measured on hardware: 14.9375 -> 15 (rounds up) while 106.5 -> 106 and
    94.5 -> 94 (ties to even), which truncation cannot produce.

    Layout per block: one shared-exponent byte then the 8 mantissa bytes.

    ``s``/``t`` are the mmul's register tiling and ``ct_k`` the k slice one
    compute tile holds at a time; all three set the blocked layout, and packing
    with the wrong value produces a wrongly ordered buffer of the RIGHT SIZE, so
    it mis-computes silently rather than raising.

    With ``bfp16`` the result is a flat uint8 tensor of bfp16ebs8 blocks (9
    bytes per 8 values); otherwise a flat bf16 tensor. The quantization is not a
    loss this adds: the AIE2P mmul only multiplies bfp16, so the bf16 path would
    convert B inside every mac anyway. Doing it here hoists a rounding that
    already happened, and makes B 9 bytes per 8 values instead of 16.

    ``overlay_order`` swaps the two within-block k axes (``i`` and ``s_in``
    below). It exists solely for the shipped image (:mod:`iron.exports.flm.gemm.shipped`), whose
    B stream is read by FastFlowLM's shipped ``mm.xclbin``, not by a kernel
    built here: that overlay's own loop nest sweeps ``s_in`` outer and ``i``
    inner, the reverse of ``mm_fused_mmul_2x2``'s ``i``-outer loop. The
    now-deleted ``flm_pack_B`` (see ``bench_vs_flm.py`` history) verified this
    ordering against the overlay via ``tile.reshape(...).transpose(2, 1, 0,
