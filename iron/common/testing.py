"""How an operator declares the shapes it is tested at.

An operator knows its own valid shapes: which column counts divide its
size, how large a line its kernel holds, which layout flags change what is
built. So it declares them beside itself, as :class:`Testing` on the class,
and ``iron/operators/test.py`` runs every declaration against the
operator's ``reference()`` on a device.

``iron/tests/common/cases.py`` is a different matrix and stays: one small
pinned case per shape decision, constructed device-free and lowered by the
toolchain gate. These cases are the device's, sized to stress it.

A declaration is data. Nothing here imports pytest or torch, so an
operator module stays importable without them; the runner turns the data
into parameters.
