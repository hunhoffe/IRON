"""A graph function, and the images it compiles to.

A graph function is compiled once per input signature (shapes and dtypes):
each is a *version*, its own image. Every version reads the same weights
and states, and on a full ELF they share one scratch arena
(:class:`~iron.common.image.ArenaPlan`), so a weight is on the device once
and a state one version writes is where the next reads it. Nothing asks for
this: calling the function with a new shape compiles a version into the
arena its other versions already use.
