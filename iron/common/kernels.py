"""How a design declares the kernel it calls.

One declaration, not two: ``ExternalFunction`` is the symbol and the object
at once, and upstream compiles the source and names the object from its
content, so no file name is spelled out twice.

Constructing it here, inside the design, is required rather than stylistic.
An ``ExternalFunction`` registers itself into a process-global set that
``CompilableDesign`` clears when it begins generating, so one built earlier --
in the operator, say -- is discarded and its object never compiled.

    ``bundled_sources`` names translation units the kernel needs linked but
    never calls through MLIR -- ``lut_based_ops.cpp``, whose exp/log tables
    aie2's kernels reach from C++ with no call site. ``aie-assign-core-link-files``
    finds objects by tracing ``func.call`` edges, so it can never discover
    that one. Compiling it into the same translation unit removes the orphan
    object entirely: one source, one object, nothing to discover.

    The bundle is a generated source rather than ``-include``: clang processes
    ``-include`` files before the arch macros are established, and aie_api
    rejects that with "'__AIE_ARCH__' macro is required".

    ``object_file_name`` is for a source that defines more than one entry point
    the design calls. Left to default, each declaration is named for its own
    symbol and so gets its own object -- two compiles of one translation unit,
    each defining *both* symbols, which is a duplicate definition at link.
    Pointing them at one object name instead makes them share it: identical
    source and flags give an identical content digest, so upstream neither
    reports a collision nor compiles twice.

    ``digest_prefix`` prefixes the symbol and the object with a digest of the
    kernel's recipe (:func:`recipe_digest`). Designs fused into one ELF share
    one object directory and one registry, so two naming one kernel with
    different flags (two GEMV shapes) would otherwise collide. Keyed on the
    recipe rather than on anything about the design, equal recipes -- the
    same kernel in two designs, in two graphs, or standalone and fused --
    get one symbol, one object and one compile, and different ones never
    meet. Off only for a design whose MLIR names its kernels itself
    (stream's), which must then keep distinct recipes under distinct names.

    ``symbol_prefix`` distinguishes several objects built from one source in a
    single design -- stream's GEMMs, one per tile shape, all from mm.cc. The
    digest composes with it rather than replacing it:
    "<digest>_mm128_64_64_matmul_bf16_bf16".
