    The dynamic escape for a design whose shapes come from a file rather
    than a formula (swiglu_prefill_stream's stream-dse export). ``inputs``
    and ``outputs`` are literal shapes in argument order; ``params`` are
    the numbers that identify the instance (they become ``param()`` fields
    with those defaults and reach the name); ``key`` identifies the
    generated design, for sharing; ``generator`` replaces
    :meth:`Operator.generator`, since the sequence is not derived. A class
    made this way goes through the same creation checks as one written in
    a class body.
