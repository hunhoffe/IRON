"""The operator model's declaration layer: operators and their members.

An operator is one class. Its fields fall into two tiers by what a change
rebuilds. Fields named in an operand's tile, plus fields marked
``array=True``, form the array tier; one array serves every extent of the
other fields, which size the host buffers and reach only the runtime
sequence. Values a graph binds per call are :class:`Value`,
:class:`Scratchpad` or :class:`DispatchTime` members.

Declarations are class-level. :func:`param` declares a dimension field,
:func:`auto` declares a knob the library resolves, and a shape in the class
body uses the field's bare name. An operand with ``tile=`` is its own
stream into the array::

    class GEMV(Operator):
        M: int = param()
        K: int = param()
        num_batches: int = param(default=1)
        num_aie_columns: int = auto()
        tile_size_output: int = auto(64)

        A = In(optional(num_batches), M, K, tile=(tile_size_output, K), per=(num_aie_columns,))
        B = In(optional(num_batches), K, tile=(K,), per=(num_aie_columns,))
        C = Out(optional(num_batches), M, tile=(tile_size_output,), per=(num_aie_columns,))
        tiles = Value(np.int32, derive=lambda op: op.M // (op.num_aie_columns * op.tile_size_output))

A host buffer's dimension is a ``param()`` field or an integer literal:
never a knob, a per-call value or an expression. This keeps inference a
lookup (:mod:`.infer`) and lets :mod:`.creation` check a class once, as its
body finishes. A tile's dimension may also be a knob, since resolution
chooses the tile and inference never reads one. A :class:`Profile` applied
in a scope fills the knobs a call site leaves open, by operator shape,
before resolution runs.

:mod:`iron.common.design` generates MLIR from these declarations; this
package does not. The little of mlir-aie it touches (the device a name is
keyed on, the shim's DMA budget in :mod:`.shim`) describes the target, not
a design.

Module by module: :mod:`.field` is what a class body writes, :mod:`.member`
what it declares alongside its fields, :mod:`.bound` what an instance's
attribute returns, :mod:`.infer` how operand shapes fill a declaration's
dimension fields, :mod:`.operator` the class itself, :mod:`.creation` the
checks run as a class body finishes, and :mod:`.naming` how an instance
builds its label.
