"""What an overlay or operator declares besides its fields.

Streams are the overlay's ABI and buffers the operator's; the two agree by
construction, since a buffer names the stream it feeds or drains. The rest
name values no host buffer carries: a :class:`Scratchpad` or
:class:`DispatchTime` written per call, a :class:`Resident` written once,
before the first DMA.
