"""What a declared class goes through once its body has run.

Both layers' bases call :func:`declare` from ``__init_subclass__``, so every
subclass is processed and none can forget to be. It applies ``dataclass``,
resolves the field objects the class body captured in its shapes to names,
re-attaches every field as a :class:`DimRef`, checks the shape rule, and
records the members in declaration order. What it cannot prove then -- an
operator's extents against a tuned overlay -- is left to
:func:`~iron.common.declare.infer`.
