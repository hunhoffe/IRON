"""Infrastructure tests for :mod:`iron.common.image.allocator`, the memory planner.

Pure logic over synthetic runlists -- no operators, no toolchain, no hardware.
The properties that matter are: a plan never lets two simultaneously-live
buffers share bytes (correctness), it reaches the peak-liveness lower bound on
the shapes real models produce (quality), and it leaves host-addressed buffers
alone (pinning).
