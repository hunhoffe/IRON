"""A fused build must not leave its MLIR in the standalone operator's slot.

A fused build once renamed each design's kernels by position::

    generator.kwargs["func_prefix"] = f"op{idx}_"

on a generator that was also an artifact the fused build compiled to disk --
to the exact path a standalone build of the same operator reads. The cache
keyed only on filename and mtime, so a later standalone build trusted the
prefixed file and asked the linker for ``op0_add.o``, which a standalone
build never produces. The failure surfaced as an undefined symbol at link
time, in a build that did nothing wrong, possibly in a different process from
the fused build that poisoned it.

Nothing is left to poison now: fused MLIR is not an artifact, standalone
builds call their generator directly, and a kernel is named for its recipe
rather than its position, so a design names the same objects whether it is
built alone or fused. The last is what is checked here, end to end.

Needs a device: the fused build runs for real, because the whole point is
what it leaves lying around; the standalone side only needs a device to
generate its own MLIR at all (device-specialized designs read the current
device), not to compile anything.
