"""One graph function, called at two shapes, is two images over one arena.

Each input signature compiles its own version, and every full-ELF version
runs in the function's one scratch arena: a weight is placed and uploaded
once, and a state one version writes is the bytes the next reads. These run
on the device, because the claim is about bytes -- two hw contexts over one
buffer object, offsets baked into two ELFs -- and a wrong offset produces
wrong numbers, not an error.

The function below writes its state at one shape and reads it at the other:
``f(x)`` with ``x`` one line long stores ``x + w`` in the state and returns
``x + 2w``; with ``x`` two lines long it returns ``(x + w2)[second line] +
state``.
