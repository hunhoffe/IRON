"""The fused image itself: graph functions build to a full ELF.

One step past ``lowering.py``. Where that gate stops at the instruction
stream, this one runs the whole of aiecc's full-ELF pipeline on a traced
graph: every operator's kernels compile with Peano, every core links, each
design's PDI is generated, and ``aiebu-asm`` assembles the per-device
instruction streams and the PDIs into the one ELF ``xrt::module`` loads.
Needs Peano (the ``llvm-aie`` wheel) and ``aiebu-asm`` on the PATH, and
still no device; the numbers remain hardware's to check.

What it adds to the lowering gate is the scratchpad parameter table:
``--get-scratchpad-parameters`` only emits it on the full-ELF path, and it
is where a graph's bound per-call values become something the host writes
through. The decode graph binds two, so its table must name both.

The swiglu graph goes through ``GraphFunction.compile`` itself, so the one
build also checks the packaging surface end to end: ``compile(dev,
image=)`` derives the dispatch, traces, builds and links the ELF, and the
runtime that would load it is not made until the first call. A build host
with the toolchain and no device compiles ahead of time and hands the
image on.
