"""A fused image names its kernels, its devices and itself by content.

Each is what lets one build reuse another's work: a kernel object shared by
the designs (and graphs) whose recipes agree, a device aiecc has placed
before, a whole image found without fusing it again. A name derived from a
position instead -- which step a design is, where a kernel's design sits --
compiles once per position and moves when a graph gains a step.

No toolchain and no NPU: the fused text and the key are generated in
process, and the one cross-process check runs a second interpreter.
